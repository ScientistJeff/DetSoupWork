We endeavor to shed light on the impact that chemicals have on not just our environment but in our bodies. People will see that natural is better and you don’t have to be wealthy, high maintenance or highly educated to know the benefits of using all natural products to treat your hair. Women will see themselves as beautiful again and still be Oh So Curly!

Natural Works not only cares about producing quality products that are “truly” natural, but we also care about the community and target customers we are serving.

Therefore, we are committed to educating first, especially (but not limited to) women regarding these chemical agents, their effects on the physical body and their tragic outcomes.

For the ages 14-18 the main focus is education, how to succeed in high school, how to succeed at college, and to obtain their goals with out cheapening themselves.  Instilling morals, standards and values that will carry them throughout their adult life.  My heart is for those that have been left along the way...young ladies that are over 18-21 and have no focus, no job skills, no education, and no means of direction and singles mothers. They are key because most facilities stop working with youth by the age of 18-21 depending on the agency but I have encountered at our church and with the various programs I am associated with that outside of Social Services their is very little assistance for this targeted group.","In the past three months, I have personally assisted three young ladies in the Highland Park area.  One had three children, no food, no job and no hope.  I personally looked all over the Metro Detroit Area for help but because she had a home wasn't abuse and over the age limit I couldn't find her any assistance.  In the Highland Park community their are many Young Adults that have no hope or focus.  They walk the streets either doing drugs, selling drugs or themselves.  Our goal as a church is to have the same program for young men, but lets be truthful men  take longer to seek help, but where ladies are men will follow.

We want to build another community garden spring 2015.  Our group called ""Dirtroit"" has been operating it's own heirloom seed bank for several years.  We also build pop-up gardens each spring for the last 4 years.  All winter we crowd fund and then in the spring we build a pop-up garden somewhere in the city.  We provide all the labor and materials as well as all the heirloom organic non-GMO plants all ready for transplanting the day the garden goes in.  We show up one Saturday morning and when we leave there's a garden there.   ","Our group has already enhanced this historic location by adding public art on this site in 2012.  We are hoping to not only add more art but in the future, but also build a place where organic food can be grown instead of an abandoned lot and in the process create a communal place where people can learn and grow together.

This large step-van (like an ice-cream truck) will allow locally made products, community art projects, and art education opportunities to reach diverse communities across Detroit. Given the scale of the city and substandard public transportation, there is a lack of accessibility to such opportunities as a consumer of culture and of goods. There is a lot happening in the city and opportunities for citizens to engage, however oftentimes participants cannot take part due to transportation difficulties. Using the SWAGON, artists and social entrepreneurs will be able to better share their time and talents with a broader audience. 

Additionally, local entrepreneurs, especially those who are trying out new products and ventures, face many challenges when trying to get off the ground. The complications with building codes, permitting and the overhead costs to set up and maintain a brick-and-mortar venue can be prohibitive. The SWAGON would be available for free or at very low cost to individuals wanting to pursue a creative entrepreneurial venture to test it out in varying venues. 

We envision the SWAGON being present at the many festivals in Detroit like Jazzin’ on Jefferson, Movement, Dally in the Alley, Jazz Fest, Summer Art Fest, the Concert of Colors, and others. Local makers would be able to bring their products to a specific audience and build a base of support. While at these festivals, both entrepreneurs and artists can demonstrate how their products or their art objects are created, making for a participatory and engaging experience. Also, users of the vehicle would be encouraged to travel to the neighborhoods in which they live and where they have connections to offer programming. The SWAGON will allow the very large and disparate landscape of Detroit to become smaller and more connected.","The SWAGON will benefit the downtown community by providing more engagement with art and design. Downtown Detroit has a lot to offer in terms of sports, dining, performing arts and recreation, however, there is a lack of hands-on art activities (except for the Carr Center – which we love!) like that in the museum district in Midtown. The SWAGON is in the process of working with Detroit 300 Conservancy and partnering them to provide make-and-take activities at the numerous park spaces they manage, as well as the festivals and concerts that they support. Downtown residents and employees will be able to walk out their front door and experience paper-making, silk-screening techniques, and other artistic processes that are hands-on and accessible. 

The SWAGON will also benefit emerging entrepreneurs and consumers who live and work in downtown. As rents increase immensely in the neighborhood, it becomes more difficult for small businesses to have a presence and sell their wares to residents and visitors. It diversifies the retail landscape of downtown. Rather than being a place where only large, national chains can survive, the SWAGON offers a viable option for retailers and customers. It provides a direct, tangible connection to makers and clientele.","We will use SOUP funding primarily to purchase vehicle insurance, as this is the main roadblock to making the SWAGON operational. Given the high cost of insurance in Detroit, we would benefit tremendously from financial assistance in this regard. We also require some funding to properly permit the vehicle for involvement in area festivals and community events. 
Other important parts of the SWAGON project that require funding are the painting of the vehicle’s exterior, the design and building of a ramp to move materials in and out with ease, and a repair fund for potential mechanical issues that could occur.","We expect to launch SWAGON on Monday, March 31st at the Tiger’s home opener to introduce the project to the downtown community and the larger metro Detroit community. The SWAGON will then be operational for many other opportunities throughout the spring and summer in 2014 from events at Campus Martius, the Lafayette Greens, Capitol Park, Rouge Park and beyond. We then expect the SWAGON to continue to be a resource for other artists and entrepreneurs who need access to a shared vehicle. 
We would love for the SWAGON to be an event space for one of the Downtown SOUP gatherings this summer. We could transport materials, park, and then serve up soup, salad, and bread from within the vehicle. Participants could gather just outside the SWAGON in the Lafayette Greens to hear project proposals and to socialize. We think this would be a fun way to share the progress of the SWAGON as a community resource and a creative way to engage conversation.",SWAGON - Creativity Transported,Downtown,503-381-7283,4 - 1 - 2 and 1 abstane - invitation sent - called left vm - confirmed via email2/11/14 9:49,Noah Kaminsky,noah.a.kaminsky@gmail.com,"BackBeat Detroit will be Detroit's only music equipment retail shop and is likely to open within the next year. BackBeat will have a community-oriented appeal, and make sure that all clerks are extremely knowledgable of every product in the store.

The retail aspect, in order to avoid having to compare with the price margins from big box stores and online retailers, will feature a number of locally manufactured instrument brands. With regards to consignment, for 22% of the final sale price, BackBeat will display and sell your equipment in our highly-visible storefront. Our repair program will only charge for parts and labor, as opposed to the dehumanizing and expensive repair process at big box chains.

During summer months, the lawn surrounding the church is well-manicured and the brilliantly colored flowers and shrubs bring beauty to this inner city community. But the neighborhood surrounding the church is an eyesore. This summer, there was grass that had grown as tall as myself making it dangerous for anyone choosing to walk day or night. Up and down Joy Road, from Greenfield to Southfield, there are vacant fields littered with broken glass, weeds, and illegal dumping. There is rat infestation.

Through innovative/engaging programing we are nurturing change-makers in the Detroit food system. 

Our current food system is based on abuse. Abuse of land, low-income food-service/food production workers, cheap fossil fuels, and the communities where subsidized, cheap, processed foods are readily available in the place of healthful, fresh, nutrient rich foods. 

Over the course of 2 months and 50 hours Next Top Chef provides students with hands-on food system workshops and culinary basic lessons. They learn about the issues of food production and access that effect our communities as well as about the career paths within the ""good food movement."" Armed with knowledge about the importance of local food and the local food system students are placed on four culinary competition teams paired with talented Detroit chefs. Together with their chefs they train to execute a menu based on local, sustainable food ingredients for a live competition June 22nd in Eastern Market.","This project matters to the Detroit community because while we have been a recent local hot-spot for innovative food projects we need to build greater diversity within our good-food movement. If we are going to change our food system for all Detroiters the conversation needs to happen not just in chic downtown restaurants and coffee shops whose (delicious!) products are available to very few but in schools, neighborhoods, and family homes.

The mission of Humble Design is to connect families in need with home furnishings to create a stable, sustainable home environment. Humble Design helps transform four bare walls into a safe, dignified, and welcoming home by re-purposing gently used household goods, allowing family members to focus on improving education, home life, employment, and building a better future.

Humble Design is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit interior design company serving Metro Detroit. Through private and corporate donations, we provide thrifty and free home makeovers for clients selected through recommendations of charitable organizations in our community. Humble Design partners with local area homeless shelters to identify families that are emerging into low-income housing. Many of these families are victims of domestic abuse and have left behind all personal items upon escaping and entering an emergency shelter. Most have no beds, books, toys, or furniture to call their own.

Thankfully, only 2% of families equipped with our services returned to homeless shelters over the past four years. Humble Design is greatly reducing homeless shelter recidivism. 

All families in need exiting local shelters are eligible to receive our services. The population served by our organization is predominantly single mothers with two or more children who are transitioning from a shelter into permanent housing. Our clients are 92% African American women within the Detroit city limits. We serve an average of two to five families per week or approximately 125 families per year. 

Awareness of Humble Design's program has increased and so has the demand for the services. In response, Humble Design is seeking to expand its operational capacity in order to reach more families. The grant funds will be applied to purchase a moving truck. Humble Design does not own a moving truck despite our mission of furnishing families’ lives. Our most recent 2011 financial audit reflects transportation as one of Humble Design’s most costly budget line item in the amount of $20,272. With each family whose life we furnish, transportation alone averages $500.00 per move including, but is not limited to, fuel expenses and truck rental fees. With the project goal of owning our own truck by the end of 2014, those funds will be will be freed up and allocated to pay for much needed beds. 

Our project's goal is to raise $30,000 (or any portion thereof) for the cost of purchasing and owning a 15-foot a moving truck.","Currently, Humble Design serves the geographic areas including: Oakland, Macomb and Wayne County. Our offices are based in Troy. Humble Design will no longer have to turn away families in need due to our second largest budget expense, transportation. 

We seek to collaborate with partners and opportunities like Detroit Soup who share in our ongoing, mutual goals of positively impacting the great city of Detroit. Humble's personal goals include; decreasing shelter recidivism rates while providing safe and stable housing. Our services help families in need make a final exit from the “revolving door” of homeless shelters. By giving families in crisis the opportunity to receive a springboard for success, we are giving our clients the ability to achieve economic stability. Thus, as a result, benefiting Detroit’s economy. The children of our families will also have a chance at success with a consistent, secure environment, encouraging academic success. Without Humble Design, a child is more susceptible to abuse and unsafe and unstable housing as evident in current shelter recidivism rates. 

A crystal ball for children and families who lack resources and services from our organization entails dropping out of school, the abuse of drugs and alcohol and homelessness. Humble Design helps families have a chance to not only survive and thrive for their own journey in life, but to enhance the livelihood of our community. Let’s help these children become part of our workforce as teachers, doctors, healthy parents, and even leaders for future generations. Humble Design is one of the first points of contact for referral that can help a child from “cradle to career.”

Hopefully, with Detroit SOUP, we can raise more awareness and funds to meet our mission of helping even more families in need.","We hope to own a moving truck by the end of 2014. We would be more than thrilled to drive our truck (should we receive the full funding by this time) equipped with information and video clips on Humble Design to an upcoming SOUP. We can also have a client provide their personal story and testimony in response to your generosity. 

We will be happy to share and present our journey of fulfilling this project and it will be delivered with the utmost creativity, warmth and care. 

Thank you again for your time and consideration of this request. We look forward to the possibility of receiving your generosity so that we may continue to successfully serve families in need.","SOUP's grant funding will directly benefit our ongoing mission of furnishing a family's future by allowing us to purchase a moving truck. 

Funds for a moving truck will enable Humble Design to continue to move families out of shelters and into permanent housing with furnishing their lives with necessities they would otherwise go without. Thus, allowing our families to focus on their employment and their children’s academic achievements to promote their future sustainability within the workforce.

Owner and baker Lisa Ludwinski moved back to Michigan after six years in Brooklyn to launch Sister Pie last fall. She aims to celebrate the seasons with pie by carefully creating a new menu every month. 

As a cottage food business, Lisa has been to able to cook out of a home kitchen for the past eight months - first in her (very supportive and loving) parents' kitchen out in Milford, and then in Ferndale where she sublets a room in her (very supportive and amazing) friend's house. Through all of this, Lisa's vision for Sister Pie has been focused on Detroit - she wants to cook for the people in Detroit and be a part of that community, both professionally and personally. She has spent many hours driving back and forth to Detroit - delivering pies, participating in events, going to SOUPs, and learning about the needs of the communities. 

Next month, Lisa is moving to an apartment in Woodbridge. She will not continue to operate under the cottage food law, as Sister Pie is growing rapidly - sales from May to June tripled. If Lisa and Sister Pie can move into a space (through Detroit Kitchen Connect, or otherwise), sweet pies, savory pies, cookies, and more can be sold in grocery stores and/or to restaurants. This is an ideal stepping stone between now and the ultimate goal - opening a full-service breakfast and lunch restaurant/pie shop in Detroit. 

As Sister Pie grows, so does our mission. We aim to: 
To celebrate the seasons through pie; to inspire open-mindedness towards culturally-diverse cuisine; to provide consistently delicious, nutritious, and inventive food; to foster a welcoming environment for employees and customers through education, community growth, and charity work.","For Sister Pie, the goal of feeding the people of Detroit moves beyond traditional fork-to-mouth conceptions. The idea of ""sisterhood"" is where Lisa draws much of inspiration for growing a triple bottom line business. Specifically, Lisa hopes to empower women through not only offering employment as cooks and bakers, but through providing access to healthy, thoughtful, and nourishing cuisine. 

People connect through food - Detroit SOUP is a perfect example. Communities come together when there is food at the table. Pie has been bringing people together for ages - women, standing around a kitchen table, pitting cherries and rolling out pie dough; a family at the holidays, passing around slices of pumpkin pie, with someone dolloping whipped cream on each plate; and Sister Pie, a local business with heart and soul, inviting people to the community table for conversation, cooking together, and good old-fashioned food (with a twist!) 

Beyond pie, the brick-and-mortar location will service the larger Detroit community with the aforementioned natural, whole-food options. Breakfast and lunch will consist of menu items like: free-range eggs cooked with greens and oat bran (it's actually delicious), nutty buckwheat banana pancakes, and big grain salads jam packed with seasonal produce, healthy fats, nuts, and mostly vegetarian proteins. Detroit definitely has a need for breakfast-and-lunch joints that focus on this type of wholesome cuisine.","I am planning to spend the month of August moving the kitchen into a commercial space, so will be working on the above list as soon as the money goals are realized. 

At an upcoming SOUP, I could share my process for moving from cottage food to a commercial space (which could be really helpful for many of the food entrepreneurs out there), applying for the licenses and taking the class, and I could also talk about the growth that my business will have once there is access to a greater pool of customers and opportunities. Finally, I'd love to share my ""next step"" plans for Sister Pie beyond the commercial kitchen space and into a brick-and-mortar.","To move into a commercial space, Sister Pie will need to raise at least $1000 to acquire the necessary items for a smooth and successful transition. Details are below. 

1. ServSafe Food Safety Class (to get certification) - $225. 
2. Kitchen deposit - $200
3. $1 Million in General Liability Insurance - $300-500
4. Miscellaneous equipment needed once in commercial space: $200
TOTAL: $1000 - 1225",Detroit SOUP (Jam Handy),,Y7/19/13 10:51,Kristen Selle,kristen@mackave.com,MACC Lit,"MACC Lit exists to eliminate illiteracy in the 48214 zip code of Detroit. Over the past three years, MACC Lit has worked with over 50 students to improve their literacy skills in a healthy and encouraging environment. Each child is individually cared for by a tutor, a rarity in most schools. Their progress is also evaluated prior to- and at the conclusion of- each semester. On average, students attending MACC Lit have improved 2.4 grade levels in one school year! 
In addition to one-on-one tutoring, MACC Lit holds Community Family nights once a month to promote a culture of literacy and healthy families. The families in the program are required to attend the Family Nights in addition to the tutoring twice a week. These meetings are a great time for training parents in ways to improve their child's literacy at home.","Improving the city's education system and economy are well known needs in Detroit and critical components to its revival. Research has shown education attainment and future economic success go hand in hand. Detroit presently offers its students an estimated graduation rate of 37.4%; a figure that earns it a ranking of 48 out of 50 when compared to the U.S.'s largest cities. Fourth grade students in the Detroit Public Schools posted the worst scores in the nation on the Reading component of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) in 2009. Seventy three percent of them were rated as “below basic” in reading; compared to 34% nationally or even 46% for big cities. Detroit at large has a functional literacy rate approaching 50%.
Whether a child can adequately and confidently read on grade level will cast the course for their educational trajectory. For example, children placed in high-ability groups are likely to continue to perform at that level and go on to college. By comparison, students sentenced to low-achievement placements will remain in those groups throughout their educational experience and be far more likely to (1) leave school before graduating; (2) fail a grade; (3) be placed in special education; (4) become a teenage parent; (5) commit a criminal offense as a juvenile; and (6) remain less than fully literate throughout adulthood, according to the National Institute for Literacy.
If these children do not develop the needed literacy skills while in school, life for them will not get any easier as they reach adulthood. The odds of being on welfare goes up as literacy levels go down. Individuals reading at the lowest literacy levels are 10 times more likely to live in poverty than those who can read at the highest levels, earning almost 2/3 less and working half as many hours a week. Seven in ten prisoners read at the two lowest levels.",The funds from SOUP would be used to purchase materials by September 2013 and we would love to share about the use of the funds at an upcoming SOUP thereafter.,"If awarded, MACC Lit would use the funds from Detroit SOUP to supply much needed materials and furniture for our newly renovated space. In the past, MACC Lit has had to rent space from local churches. In an effort to use that rent money towards a lasting investment in the community, we will be moving to the MACC Development building at 7900 Mack Ave. The building is not equipped to house a tutoring clinic yet and we are in need of funding to create this welcoming space.",Detroit SOUP (Jam Handy),,Y8/3/13 1:34,Marrissa Sheehy,lauraleafiyak@aol.com,Eve's Angels,"We are a non-profit organization new to the Detroit area. We provide hope, love, support, and resources to women trapped in the sex industry in the area. Some of these women are being trafficked as well. We also provide a support group every Thursday evening to those that are not just looking for a way out, but to just be loved and cared for. Most of these women have been abused in some way as children, and it just becomes an UNHAPPY part of their lives as adults, and some are forced into it. Many times this way of life, turns into drugs and a violent relationships as well.This is a VERY common way of life here in Detroit especially.","There are 46 strip clubs alone in just the city of Detroit. We do community outreach with these women in the clubs by bringing in gift bags to the girls that contain information about who we are and how we can help, baked goods, chocolates, etc and we just build relationships and trust. They love our visits usually. A hopeful face. We also have connections to safe houses, food pantries, and workshops for these women that need help in these areas.

We are also partnering with other non-profits that provide hygiene kits to those women that are actually on the streets.","We are actively in outreach twice a month or more and could always use the help. Marrissa Sheehy the leader is a woman of rescue by Eve's Angels, and she would speak to announce what we do and how this organization has helped her.

The social intelligence and relevance of the author is remarkable and mirrors many issues today. “Othello”, for example, is the story of a man who despite his success still made society in Venice very uncomfortable because he didn’t look like them and he wasn’t what they were used to – Othello took many people out of their comfort zone like Brabantio who was uncomfortable that his daughter, Desdemona, married someone of a different race. We see this same discomfort as Detroit experiences changes like the mayoral election with a candidate who doesn’t look like the majority of the population of the city, for example. 

Macbeth is another great example of Shakespeare’s social relevancy. He explored mental health in the play before words like psychosis, psychiatrist, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and other terms existed. 
The only difference between now and Shakespeare’s time is the language and the clothing. Other than those things, mankind in this city, and out of it, is the same.

Why does Shakespeare in Detroit matter? Detroit is an amazing place to create and experience art from its music to its visual artists to its theater. But something is missing – Shakespeare in the Park. Most major cities have annual Shakespeare in the Park performances including Chicago, New York, Los Angeles and Miami. There is a hunger for The Bard in Detroit. And this summer we had the opportunity to prove that point at Grand Circus Park during a free performance of “Othello.” 

We made history with the first-ever free outdoor Shakespeare experience in Detroit which approximately 400 people showed up to see. The show included authentic restoration costumes and a cast of 16 all-local actors. 

It’s impossible to have a whole theater community without the presence of a substantial Shakespeare experience. We have a long way to go, but we would like to fill that void with live theater and other efforts like our outreach program, Shakespeare Against Cancer – a volunteer project that facilitates local actors to visit youth between the ages of 2 and 17 and perform vignettes based on Shakespeare’s works as a respite during chemotherapy. 

In addition to entertaining and educating patrons through Shakespeare’s folios of work, Shakespeare in Detroit also employs all local artists and other skilled tradesmen and women who otherwise might find work elsewhere – and outside of the city’s boundaries. 
Shakespeare in Detroit is an employer. It is an educational tool. It is a contributor to the rich creative community. It exposes those who may not have access to seeing Shakespeare’s works live and onstage. It is entertainment. It is a respite. It’s an experience.","It's going to take me a few weeks for pre-production and securing a director and actors. After that we have the rehearsal process. There is also the holidays in the midst of all this activity. So we would be able to do the show early March of 2014, and we'd absolutely love to come back before the show to update everyone on the production process and invite everyone to come see it. 

It would be a dream if we could perform a scene from the show prior to our opening for a SOUP audience.","The SOUP grant funding would be used towards our next show in March 2014. Specifically, the funding would go towards a location in downtown Detroit. 

We'd like to find an area to perform one of Shakespeare's epic love stories, at a fair price. The current concept is to do the show in a park, inside of a heated tent. 

Depending on the funding amount, we could also possibly use the grant to secure costumes or other needed props or items for the show which will probably be Antony and Cleopatra.",Detroit SOUP (Jam Handy),,Y9/15/13 11:58,Marrissa Sheehy,lauraleafiyak@aol.com,Eve's Angels,"I think we probably have the most unique, but a VERY necessary kind of non-profit work in the city of Detroit. Eve's Angels is an organization of 3 years started by Anny Donewald, that gives resources and support to women that are trapped in the sex-industry and/or being sex trafficked. Detroit is the newest city of the 7 chapters. Just a few statistics before I get started. There are 46 strip clubs alone in the city of Detroit, NOT including the suburbs. (most pimping starts in the clubs)Detroit is one of the top ten cities in America of traffick victims. Only 1 in 20 pimps are caught and arrested, and a full-time pimp makes $182,000 a yr off of ONE victim. Pimping is only a misdemeanor for a first time offense in Michigan. This sad truth had led Anny to a passion to do something to help these women. These women do NOT desire to go into the clubs to gain a lavish life. Most of these women have been sexually, emotionally, and physically abused growing up, and still are. Some are forced by pimps, and some just feel trapped after thinking it was a good idea at the beginning to raise money to support their kids.Most drink and become drug addicts to hide their pain and to just get through their job, and that allows them to become more trapped and to fall into the hands of the wrong people.

We first have a team that goes into the strip clubs to drop off gift bags to the girls that have items such as resource info, baked goods, lip glosses, girly thing ect.. This helps us build realtionships and trust with the girls so that if they desire a way out, they feel they can come to us. We provide things such as: resumes, better, more safe job placement outside of the industry, food and hygiene items, support groups, housing, detox, counsel, and other information required to get them on their feet and that would help them function in society safely. Our greatest passion is to raise money for a safe house for these girls that have made the decision to leave their dangerous situations. We currently have women that need a place to live NOW, and until we are able to provide housing ourselves, these women are stuck in very unhealthy and unsafe situations.of course we would like to offer all of the help mentioned above, in our OWN safe house and all ""in-house."" IF we can purchase a house, we could then offer workshops for the women that are both theraputic AND give life-skills. We would have a team that walks along side them to mentor them, and just provide all of their needs to get themselves healthy and safe again.",This project has a vision to get women off the streets and aid those that are serious about getting out of their unsafe situations in the clubs and sex industry. We educate these women to realize they are worth something and help them to become functional in society and in hopes for them to become better parents if they are one. These things would ALL greatly benefit the city of Detroit.,Our goal is always progressing. OF course we have have an urgency for the women that are in need of our help now. Hopefully we can get a house within 6 months and come back to share our progress. :),"We have girls currently looking for a way out and a safe place to live, so the money would be put toward a safe house and things like, food, furniture, hygiene items, and programs for the girls in the house.",Detroit SOUP,,Y9/20/13 19:21,"Bright Teens (Amber Ross, Devonta' Pye)",amberlynn8196@gmail.com,Bright Teens Teen Nights,"We are Bright Teens!

Our goal is to provide affordable high quality arts training to youth ages 3-18 from all socioeconomic groups. At D.A.N.C.E., we believe in training the whole individual; all of our participants, who are referred to as S.T.A.R.S.

We are currently raising funds to purchase a permanent storage pod for the park. The storage pod will house City of Detroit maintenance equipment. The City has agreed to upgrade the status of Stoepel Park No. 1 to that of “Satellite Park”, one of only five parks in the City to be granted that status. Satellite Park status will bring us two full-time City General Services Department employees, who will be stationed at Stoepel from April through September every year. These employees will mow, weed-whip, landscape, pick up and dispose of trash, remove graffiti and excess brush, and repair park equipment, as needed. In order to obtain the Satellite Park status, however, the community needs to provide storage for the City’s maintenance equipment. 

The reason that Stoepel is being designated with Satellite Park status is that our community has created an almost unprecedented level of partnership between the City, County, private funding community and community organizations to successfully complete improvements at Stoepel. We have raised over $565,000 for a variety of park improvements, including fencing in the baseball fields, installing a new parking lot, installing a new walking path around the baseball fields, installing warning tracks and bleachers, and repairing existing fencing. We are still trying to raise funds for the rest of the field improvements, which include renovating the dugouts and installing permanent foul poles. We are also still trying to raise the rest of the funds for the storage pod.","The four baseball fields at Stoepel Park No. 1 are the principal play fields of the Rosedale Grandmont Little League (RGLL), which serves over 500 youth annually from our northwest Detroit community. The football fields are the principal playfields of the Broncos, a Detroit PAL football and cheerleading program serving hundreds of area youth. Thousands of people come to Stoepel Park No. 1 every year to enjoy the baseball and football fields, playgrounds, picnic grounds, basketball courts, and tennis courts. 

For years, both the baseball league and football league have used their own funds to mow the grass and maintain their fields. These funds could be used by the leagues for better equipment, providing a higher ratio of referees and umpires, and for scholarships for youth who cannot afford the programs. 

By installing a permanent storage pod and making Stoepel a Satellite Park, we will: 
1. Maintain Stoepel Park No. 1 as a safe and clean place for our residents
2. Provide access to positive youth development activities and more healthy living activities
3. Increase the number of youth and families who participate in all of the activities at Stoepel
4. Spur economic development opportunities in the community
5. Instill pride and ownership in our neighborhood park and community","We plan to purchase the pod this winter so that it can be delivered, City equipment can be moved, and locks can be installed by early spring. Stoepel Park No. 1 will be a Satellite Park by April 1, 2014!

Additionally, because of MACC Sports’ affiliation with Mack Avenue Community Church, children are trained in biblical values, allowing our community to be one that supports parents in raising their children to be young men and women of integrity. Finally, the entire MACC Sports community, including children’s parents and relatives, gather on Saturdays for their weekly matches.
 The program launched its first soccer league in the fall of 2012, and has since hosted an additional spring and fall soccer season, where we have seen growing buy-in and support from our community: several local businesses have offered sponsorships, all three DPS Elementary and Middle School Principals in our zip code have invited MACC Sports to give announcements during assemblies and/or lunch times, and many families have expressed loving support. In this last season we had over 100 children involved, which added up to 14 teams comprised of 3 distinct age divisions of children between ages 4 and 12.

Lots of Love is a start-up organization, but we’ve already secured funding for our tool truck, now we just need to stock it with as many tools as possible!","There are more than 100,000 vacant lots in Detroit, and equally as many abandoned homes. Illegal dumping is rampant and virtually every Detroiter knows of a vacant property near them that could use some tender love and care. However, although there is a need and desire to transform vacant lots in Detroit, many residents lack resources like tools or transportation needed to complete the task at hand. Our mobile tool library will help build capacity for hundreds of residents, block clubs and community groups across the city by bringing tools to those without tools, those without transportation to borrow tools from others, and even for those who may already have some tools but not enough tools for a large volunteer group to help with their project.",We aim to launch Lots of Love in Spring of this year and will support community projects throughout the warm season (as well as in future years). We would be thrilled to return to an upcoming SOUP to share progress on our project (and we’ll come with pictures too).,"We’ve already raised enough money to purchase our truck, but we need funds to stock our truck with as many tools as possible.

We furnish homes with your donated goods. It's a very simple idea that can change a family's future. Our mission is to provide families in need with dignified, clean and welcoming home interiors. We minimize the impact on the environment by matching clients with donated & gently used household goods. Humble Design partners with local area homeless shelters to identify families that are emerging into low-income housing. Many of these families are victims of abuse and have left behind all personal items upon escaping and entering an emergency shelter. Most have no beds, books, toys, or furniture to call their own.","The economic struggles of Detroit in the last several years have been well documented. Many families on the economic ledge have struggled with poverty, others have lost their homes and entered community based shelters. 

We believe that struggling Detroit families deserve decent homes, and consider our services a form of uplifting re-gifting. We believe that families and especially parents and young children that come home each day to a friendly, dignified home will have more time, effort and money to focus on education, home life and building a better future. 

According to local data, without the resources and furnishings needed to remain in temporary or permanent housing, up to 73% of families return to local shelters within one year. Given the services provided by Humble Design, statistics reflect that only 2% of those served over the course of 5 years have returned to shelters.","We would implement the money donated immediately after receiving it for a family in need. 
Often times the results of Humble Design activities are tangible, meaning, and evident upon services being provided. The case workers follow up with each family served one week, three weeks, six months and finally one year after servicing the home. They ensure that the family is successfully managing the household responsibilities and are in no further need of assistance. 

We would be happy to share before and after photos and a client interview with soup to document our success.","Humble Design has calculated that it costs approximately $1,200 to assist one family. These costs include administrative expenses, moving truck, gas, furnishings, beds and supplies such as towels, vacuums, and other necessities and other associated program expenses. Therefore, a grant in any amount would allow us to serve additional families.",,248-227-5051,Y8/13/14 16:06,Clean Up Detroit,cleanupdetroit313@yahoo.com,Clean Up Detroit,"What started as a dream for one man in Detroit…..who took it upon himself to start cutting down trees, bushes and clearing out desolated lots in his neighborhood ….soon became a reality.

Every evicted family faces an almost inevitable loss to their quality of life and the building itself, once vacated, is at a very high risk of being blighted. Every family safely in a home represents stability for our communities, kids in the schools, buildings preserved from blight and an immeasurable benefit to the lives of the children.","Many short and long-term goals. In the near term, I'm helping families whose houses weren't sold in the auction appeal to buy them back from the Land Bank.

I hope to get another 10 families to save their houses before auction. Long term, I am gearing up for next year's auction. Anyone who couldn't avoid foreclosure because the back taxes were just too high or because they were a renter will be ready for the auction and the chance to buy their house for as low as $500.

We are currently raising funds to purchase a permanent storage pod for the park. The storage pod will house City of Detroit maintenance equipment. The City has agreed to upgrade the status of Stoepel Park No. 1 to that of “Satellite Park”, one of only five parks in the City to be granted that status. Satellite Park status will bring us two full-time City General Services Department employees, who will be stationed at Stoepel from April through September every year. These employees will mow, weed-whip, landscape, pick up and dispose of trash, remove graffiti and excess brush, and repair park equipment, as needed. In order to obtain the Satellite Park status, however, the community needs to provide storage for the City’s maintenance equipment. 

The reason that Stoepel is being designated with Satellite Park status is that our community has created an almost unprecedented level of partnership between the City, County, private funding community and community organizations to successfully complete improvements at Stoepel. We have raised over $565,000 for a variety of park improvements, including fencing in the baseball fields, installing a new parking lot, installing a new walking path around the baseball fields, installing warning tracks and bleachers, and repairing existing fencing. We are still trying to raise funds for the rest of the field improvements, which include renovating the dugouts and installing permanent foul poles. We are also still trying to raise the rest of the funds for the storage pod.","The four baseball fields at Stoepel Park No. 1 are the principal play fields of the Rosedale Grandmont Little League (RGLL), which serves over 500 youth annually from our northwest Detroit community. The football fields are the principal playfields of the Broncos, a Detroit PAL football and cheerleading program serving hundreds of area youth. Thousands of people come to Stoepel Park No. 1 every year to enjoy the baseball and football fields, playgrounds, picnic grounds, basketball courts, and tennis courts. 

For years, both the baseball league and football league have used their own funds to mow the grass and maintain their fields. These funds could be used by the leagues for better equipment, providing a higher ratio of referees and umpires, and for scholarships for youth who cannot afford the programs. 

By installing a permanent storage pod and making Stoepel a Satellite Park, we will: 
1. Maintain Stoepel Park No. 1 as a safe and clean place for our residents
2. Provide access to positive youth development activities and more healthy living activities
3. Increase the number of youth and families who participate in all of the activities at Stoepel
4. Spur economic development opportunities in the community
5. Instill pride and ownership in our neighborhood park and community","We plan to purchase the pod this winter so that it can be delivered, City equipment can be moved, and locks can be installed by early spring. Stoepel Park No. 1 will be a Satellite Park by April 1, 2014!

Over the course of 2 months and 50 hours Next Top Chef provides students with hands-on food system workshops and culinary basic lessons. They learn about the issues of food production and access that effect our communities as well as about the career paths within the ""good food movement."" Armed with knowledge about the importance of local food and the local food system students are placed on four culinary competition teams paired with talented Detroit chefs. Together with their chefs they train to execute a menu based on local, sustainable food ingredients for a live competition June 22nd in Eastern Market.","This project matters to the Detroit community because while we have been a recent local hot-spot for innovative food projects we need to build greater diversity within our good-food movement.

The mission of Humble Design is to connect families in need with home furnishings to create a stable, sustainable home environment. Humble Design helps transform four bare walls into a safe, dignified, and welcoming home by re-purposing gently used household goods, allowing family members to focus on improving education, home life, employment, and building a better future.

Humble Design is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit interior design company serving Metro Detroit. Through private and corporate donations, we provide thrifty and free home makeovers for clients selected through recommendations of charitable organizations in our community. Humble Design partners with local area homeless shelters to identify families that are emerging into low-income housing. Many of these families are victims of domestic abuse and have left behind all personal items upon escaping and entering an emergency shelter. Most have no beds, books, toys, or furniture to call their own.

Thankfully, only 2% of families equipped with our services returned to homeless shelters over the past four years. Humble Design is greatly reducing homeless shelter recidivism. 

All families in need exiting local shelters are eligible to receive our services. The population served by our organization is predominantly single mothers with two or more children who are transitioning from a shelter into permanent housing. Our clients are 92% African American women within the Detroit city limits. We serve an average of two to five families per week or approximately 125 families per year. 

Awareness of Humble Design's program has increased and so has the demand for the services. In response, Humble Design is seeking to expand its operational capacity in order to reach more families. The grant funds will be applied to purchase a moving truck. Humble Design does not own a moving truck despite our mission of furnishing families’ lives. Our most recent 2011 financial audit reflects transportation as one of Humble Design’s most costly budget line item in the amount of $20,272. With each family whose life we furnish, transportation alone averages $500.00 per move including, but is not limited to, fuel expenses and truck rental fees. With the project goal of owning our own truck by the end of 2014, those funds will be will be freed up and allocated to pay for much needed beds. 

Our project's goal is to raise $30,000 (or any portion thereof) for the cost of purchasing and owning a 15-foot a moving truck.","Currently, Humble Design serves the geographic areas including: Oakland, Macomb and Wayne County. Our offices are based in Troy. Humble Design will no longer have to turn away families in need due to our second largest budget expense, transportation. 

We seek to collaborate with partners and opportunities like Detroit Soup who share in our ongoing, mutual goals of positively impacting the great city of Detroit. Humble's personal goals include; decreasing shelter recidivism rates while providing safe and stable housing. Our services help families in need make a final exit from the “revolving door” of homeless shelters. By giving families in crisis the opportunity to receive a springboard for success, we are giving our clients the ability to achieve economic stability. Thus, as a result, benefiting Detroit’s economy. The children of our families will also have a chance at success with a consistent, secure environment, encouraging academic success. Without Humble Design, a child is more susceptible to abuse and unsafe and unstable housing as evident in current shelter recidivism rates. 

A crystal ball for children and families who lack resources and services from our organization entails dropping out of school, the abuse of drugs and alcohol and homelessness. Humble Design helps families have a chance to not only survive and thrive for their own journey in life, but to enhance the livelihood of our community. Let’s help these children become part of our workforce as teachers, doctors, healthy parents, and even leaders for future generations. Humble Design is one of the first points of contact for referral that can help a child from “cradle to career.”

Hopefully, with Detroit SOUP, we can raise more awareness and funds to meet our mission of helping even more families in need.","We hope to own a moving truck by the end of 2014. We would be more than thrilled to drive our truck (should we receive the full funding by this time) equipped with information and video clips on Humble Design to an upcoming SOUP. We can also have a client provide their personal story and testimony in response to your generosity. 

We will be happy to share and present our journey of fulfilling this project and it will be delivered with the utmost creativity, warmth and care. 

Thank you again for your time and consideration of this request. We look forward to the possibility of receiving your generosity so that we may continue to successfully serve families in need.","SOUP's grant funding will directly benefit our ongoing mission of furnishing a family's future by allowing us to purchase a moving truck. 

Funds for a moving truck will enable Humble Design to continue to move families out of shelters and into permanent housing with furnishing their lives with necessities they would otherwise go without. Thus, allowing our families to focus on their employment and their children’s academic achievements to promote their future sustainability within the workforce. Our mutual goal is to build resiliency of children and families to improve their economic well-being.

The goal is to transition disadvantaged women from a life of dependence to one of self-reliance by helping them overcome barriers to employment through the fruits of their own labor. Rebel Nell will employ and teach them how to make jewelry, educate them on business and requisite life skills and empower them to transition to an independent life.","The problem with the increasing number of disadvantaged/homeless women will not be resolved without increasing the number of job opportunities to meet societal needs in Detroit. By providing women with an opportunity to learn a marketable skill (jewelry making), employ and instill in them a sense for business, teach them the elements that they need to transition into the working world, the women will attain the confidence to overcome barriers to employment.",Our goal is to have enough funding to higher 3-4 women by October. That will enable us to get product in stores for a soft launch heading into the holiday season.,SOUP will help us purchase supplies and rental space so that we can get the ball rolling to employ the women from the shelters.,Detroit SOUP (Jam Handy),,Y6/30/13 19:53,Lisa Ludwinski,lisa.ludwinski@gmail.com,Sister Pie,"Sister Pie is a from-scratch home bakery, serving the Detroit area with seasonally driven breads, cookies, and pie. Owner and baker Lisa Ludwinski moved back to Michigan after six years in Brooklyn to launch Sister Pie last fall. She aims to celebrate the seasons with pie by carefully creating a new menu every month. 

As a cottage food business, Lisa has been to able to cook out of a home kitchen for the past eight months - first in her (very supportive and loving) parents' kitchen out in Milford, and then in Ferndale where she sublets a room in her (very supportive and amazing) friend's house. Through all of this, Lisa's vision for Sister Pie has been focused on Detroit - she wants to cook for the people in Detroit and be a part of that community, both professionally and personally. She has spent many hours driving back and forth to Detroit - delivering pies, participating in events, going to SOUPs, and learning about the needs of the communities. 

Next month, Lisa is moving to an apartment in Woodbridge. She will not continue to operate under the cottage food law, as Sister Pie is growing rapidly - sales from May to June tripled. If Lisa and Sister Pie can move into a space (through Detroit Kitchen Connect, or otherwise), sweet pies, savory pies, cookies, and more can be sold in grocery stores and/or to restaurants. This is an ideal stepping stone between now and the ultimate goal - opening a full-service breakfast and lunch restaurant/pie shop in Detroit. 

As Sister Pie grows, so does our mission. We aim to: 
To celebrate the seasons through pie; to inspire open-mindedness towards culturally-diverse cuisine; to provide consistently delicious, nutritious, and inventive food; to foster a welcoming environment for employees and customers through education, community growth, and charity work.","For Sister Pie, the goal of feeding the people of Detroit moves beyond traditional fork-to-mouth conceptions. The idea of ""sisterhood"" is where Lisa draws much of inspiration for growing a triple bottom line business. Specifically, Lisa hopes to empower women through not only offering employment as cooks and bakers, but through providing access to healthy, thoughtful, and nourishing cuisine. 

People connect through food - Detroit SOUP is a perfect example. Communities come together when there is food at the table. Pie has been bringing people together for ages - women, standing around a kitchen table, pitting cherries and rolling out pie dough; a family at the holidays, passing around slices of pumpkin pie, with someone dolloping whipped cream on each plate; and Sister Pie, a local business with heart and soul, inviting people to the community table for conversation, cooking together, and good old-fashioned food (with a twist!) 

Beyond pie, the brick-and-mortar location will service the larger Detroit community with the aforementioned natural, whole-food options. Breakfast and lunch will consist of menu items like: free-range eggs cooked with greens and oat bran (it's actually delicious), nutty buckwheat banana pancakes, and big grain salads jam packed with seasonal produce, healthy fats, nuts, and mostly vegetarian proteins. Detroit definitely has a need for breakfast-and-lunch joints that focus on this type of wholesome cuisine.","I am planning to spend the month of August moving the kitchen into a commercial space, so will be working on the above list as soon as the money goals are realized. 

At an upcoming SOUP, I could share my process for moving from cottage food to a commercial space (which could be really helpful for many of the food entrepreneurs out there), applying for the licenses and taking the class, and I could also talk about the growth that my business will have once there is access to a greater pool of customers and opportunities. Finally, I'd love to share my ""next step"" plans for Sister Pie beyond the commercial kitchen space and into a brick-and-mortar.","To move into a commercial space, Sister Pie will need to raise at least $1000 to acquire the necessary items for a smooth and successful transition. Details are below. 

1. ServSafe Food Safety Class (to get certification) - $225. 
2. Kitchen deposit - $200
3. $1 Million in General Liability Insurance - $300-500
4. Miscellaneous equipment needed once in commercial space: $200

Over the past three years, MACC Lit has worked with over 50 students to improve their literacy skills in a healthy and encouraging environment. Each child is individually cared for by a tutor, a rarity in most schools. Their progress is also evaluated prior to- and at the conclusion of- each semester. On average, students attending MACC Lit have improved 2.4 grade levels in one school year! 
In addition to one-on-one tutoring, MACC Lit holds Community Family nights once a month to promote a culture of literacy and healthy families. The families in the program are required to attend the Family Nights in addition to the tutoring twice a week. These meetings are a great time for training parents in ways to improve their child's literacy at home.","Improving the city's education system and economy are well known needs in Detroit and critical components to its revival. Research has shown education attainment and future economic success go hand in hand. Detroit presently offers its students an estimated graduation rate of 37.4%; a figure that earns it a ranking of 48 out of 50 when compared to the U.S.'s largest cities. Fourth grade students in the Detroit Public Schools posted the worst scores in the nation on the Reading component of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) in 2009. Seventy three percent of them were rated as “below basic” in reading; compared to 34% nationally or even 46% for big cities. Detroit at large has a functional literacy rate approaching 50%.
Whether a child can adequately and confidently read on grade level will cast the course for their educational trajectory. For example, children placed in high-ability groups are likely to continue to perform at that level and go on to college. By comparison, students sentenced to low-achievement placements will remain in those groups throughout their educational experience and be far more likely to (1) leave school before graduating; (2) fail a grade; (3) be placed in special education; (4) become a teenage parent; (5) commit a criminal offense as a juvenile; and (6) remain less than fully literate throughout adulthood, according to the National Institute for Literacy.
If these children do not develop the needed literacy skills while in school, life for them will not get any easier as they reach adulthood. The odds of being on welfare goes up as literacy levels go down. Individuals reading at the lowest literacy levels are 10 times more likely to live in poverty than those who can read at the highest levels, earning almost 2/3 less and working half as many hours a week. Seven in ten prisoners read at the two lowest levels.",The funds from SOUP would be used to purchase materials by September 2013 and we would love to share about the use of the funds at an upcoming SOUP thereafter.,"If awarded, MACC Lit would use the funds from Detroit SOUP to supply much needed materials and furniture for our newly renovated space.

We provide hope, love, support, and resources to women trapped in the sex industry in the area. Some of these women are being trafficked as well. We also provide a support group every Thursday evening to those that are not just looking for a way out, but to just be loved and cared for. Most of these women have been abused in some way as children, and it just becomes an UNHAPPY part of their lives as adults, and some are forced into it. Many times this way of life, turns into drugs and a violent relationships as well.This is a VERY common way of life here in Detroit especially.","There are 46 strip clubs alone in just the city of Detroit. We do community outreach with these women in the clubs by bringing in gift bags to the girls that contain information about who we are and how we can help, baked goods, chocolates, etc and we just build relationships and trust. They love our visits usually. A hopeful face. We also have connections to safe houses, food pantries, and workshops for these women that need help in these areas.

We are also partnering with other non-profits that provide hygiene kits to those women that are actually on the streets.","We are actively in outreach twice a month or more and could always use the help.

The social intelligence and relevance of the author is remarkable and mirrors many issues today. “Othello”, for example, is the story of a man who despite his success still made society in Venice very uncomfortable because he didn’t look like them and he wasn’t what they were used to – Othello took many people out of their comfort zone like Brabantio who was uncomfortable that his daughter, Desdemona, married someone of a different race. We see this same discomfort as Detroit experiences changes like the mayoral election with a candidate who doesn’t look like the majority of the population of the city, for example. 

Macbeth is another great example of Shakespeare’s social relevancy. He explored mental health in the play before words like psychosis, psychiatrist, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and other terms existed. 
The only difference between now and Shakespeare’s time is the language and the clothing. Other than those things, mankind in this city, and out of it, is the same.

Why does Shakespeare in Detroit matter? Detroit is an amazing place to create and experience art from its music to its visual artists to its theater. But something is missing – Shakespeare in the Park. Most major cities have annual Shakespeare in the Park performances including Chicago, New York, Los Angeles and Miami. There is a hunger for The Bard in Detroit. And this summer we had the opportunity to prove that point at Grand Circus Park during a free performance of “Othello.” 

We made history with the first-ever free outdoor Shakespeare experience in Detroit which approximately 400 people showed up to see. The show included authentic restoration costumes and a cast of 16 all-local actors. 

It’s impossible to have a whole theater community without the presence of a substantial Shakespeare experience. We have a long way to go, but we would like to fill that void with live theater and other efforts like our outreach program, Shakespeare Against Cancer – a volunteer project that facilitates local actors to visit youth between the ages of 2 and 17 and perform vignettes based on Shakespeare’s works as a respite during chemotherapy. 

In addition to entertaining and educating patrons through Shakespeare’s folios of work, Shakespeare in Detroit also employs all local artists and other skilled tradesmen and women who otherwise might find work elsewhere – and outside of the city’s boundaries. 
Shakespeare in Detroit is an employer. It is an educational tool. It is a contributor to the rich creative community. It exposes those who may not have access to seeing Shakespeare’s works live and onstage. It is entertainment. It is a respite. It’s an experience.","It's going to take me a few weeks for pre-production and securing a director and actors. After that we have the rehearsal process. There is also the holidays in the midst of all this activity. So we would be able to do the show early March of 2014, and we'd absolutely love to come back before the show to update everyone on the production process and invite everyone to come see it. 

It would be a dream if we could perform a scene from the show prior to our opening for a SOUP audience.","The SOUP grant funding would be used towards our next show in March 2014. Specifically, the funding would go towards a location in downtown Detroit. 

We'd like to find an area to perform one of Shakespeare's epic love stories, at a fair price. The current concept is to do the show in a park, inside of a heated tent. 

Depending on the funding amount, we could also possibly use the grant to secure costumes or other needed props or items for the show which will probably be Antony and Cleopatra.",Detroit SOUP (Jam Handy),,Y9/15/13 11:58,Marrissa Sheehy,lauraleafiyak@aol.com,Eve's Angels,"I think we probably have the most unique, but a VERY necessary kind of non-profit work in the city of Detroit. Eve's Angels is an organization of 3 years started by Anny Donewald, that gives resources and support to women that are trapped in the sex-industry and/or being sex trafficked. Detroit is the newest city of the 7 chapters. Just a few statistics before I get started. There are 46 strip clubs alone in the city of Detroit, NOT including the suburbs. (most pimping starts in the clubs)Detroit is one of the top ten cities in America of traffick victims. Only 1 in 20 pimps are caught and arrested, and a full-time pimp makes $182,000 a yr off of ONE victim. Pimping is only a misdemeanor for a first time offense in Michigan. This sad truth had led Anny to a passion to do something to help these women. These women do NOT desire to go into the clubs to gain a lavish life. Most of these women have been sexually, emotionally, and physically abused growing up, and still are. Some are forced by pimps, and some just feel trapped after thinking it was a good idea at the beginning to raise money to support their kids.Most drink and become drug addicts to hide their pain and to just get through their job, and that allows them to become more trapped and to fall into the hands of the wrong people.

We first have a team that goes into the strip clubs to drop off gift bags to the girls that have items such as resource info, baked goods, lip glosses, girly thing ect.. This helps us build realtionships and trust with the girls so that if they desire a way out, they feel they can come to us. We provide things such as: resumes, better, more safe job placement outside of the industry, food and hygiene items, support groups, housing, detox, counsel, and other information required to get them on their feet and that would help them function in society safely. Our greatest passion is to raise money for a safe house for these girls that have made the decision to leave their dangerous situations. We currently have women that need a place to live NOW, and until we are able to provide housing ourselves, these women are stuck in very unhealthy and unsafe situations.of course we would like to offer all of the help mentioned above, in our OWN safe house and all ""in-house.""

The focus of the 2014 7-week camp is to recruit, train, and mobilize 1st through 8th grade youth residing in the Jefferson –Chalmers community to become lay health promoters.  The objective of KSA is to provide educational, safe, character building, summer learning experiences and adventures for these children.  The goal is to aid and empower 80 youth to become agents of change around healthy eating and physical fitness amongst themselves, their school aged peers, in their households and neighborhood.  The project operates 3 days per week (Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays) from 12 – 4pm.  Youth will work in age-appropriate learning sessions with project staff, registered dietician, medical professionals, community garden leaders, volunteers and collaborating partners.  Children participating in the Y.E.A.H. project will receive training, resourcing, exposure and positive experiences in nutrition, gardening, healthy cooking, physical exercise/activities, small group discussions, journaling, art projects, off-site field trips and a community engaged closing ceremony, which will equip them to break the negative trend of childhood obesity and related youth diseases.  Additional instruction and encouragement will be given to youth/families on how to implement lessons learned and physical activities on their own outside of the Y.E.A.H. meeting schedule.  Participation in Y.E.A.H. will be used to springboard, create and promote healthy communities, thus reducing health disparities in our neighborhood youth and families.

Alley Wine is Detroit’s latest casual neighborhood watering hole offering a unique palette of local and international wines, cheeses, charcuterie, and other intriguing fare. Alley Wine is designed to be an approximately 900sf fit-out of an existing abandoned structure off the alley, on the property at 655 w. Alexandrine, Detroit, MI 48201.

Alley Wine’s vision for Detroit is a place of fertile entrepreneurial grounds, as it once was over a century ago. One of the main attractive forces in Detroit right now is the opportunity for those to “create”. With a nearly blank-slate, Detroit is becoming a haven for new ideas, small start-ups and other entrepreneurial/creative endeavors that continue to morph the cultural, social, and economic landscape that we’re so fortunate to be living in.

Since each of the two partners of Alley Wine has lived in the city for a combined 30 years, we’re fully-vested in the continuation of the positive changes we’re witnessing around us. Additionally, with one of the partners living on the same block where Alley Wine is proposed, we are further committed to being a positive force in the neighborhood for years to come.

The Alley Wine partners seek to improve our neighborhood by gently infusing positive economic and social activity to an otherwise obsolete, abandoned eyesore, an existing 4-car garage which Alley Wine already owns debt-free, on an otherwise under-used alley. How can Alley Wine benefit our neighborhood?
• Eliminate one more property from blight
• Utilize the last vacant property on the south side of W. Alexandrine between 2nd and 3rd avenues
• Create a “green” aesthetic from both W. Alexandrine and the alley between Alexandrine/Selden, 2nd/3rd Avenues
• Put more “eyes” on the street and alley behind our property, increasing public safety
• Generate new diverse social activity into our neighborhood
• Generate economic activity that will re-circulate within our neighborhood
• Partner with other owners to clean up the alley behind our properties, similar to the Green Alley (future phase)
• Market our neighborhood abroad as a unique urban destination
• Increase nearby property values

The design calls for re-use of the existing dilapidated brick 4-car garage shell on the alley of 655 W. Alexandrine. We will rebuild the alley-facing façade maintaining the existing 4-car bay’s, putting in 2-full-glazed sectional overhead doors, and 2-full-glazed aluminum curtain walls fronted by raised planters. The remainder of the lot will be re-landscaped to include a crushed gravel path from W. Alexandrine back to our building flanked by rows of flowering fruit trees, planter beds, grape vines, and shrubbery for privacy and sound reduction. It is planned that there will be a small outdoor seating area adjacent to the building, limited to warmer months.

The venue is proposed to be a year-round business beginning with operating hours of 3:00pm-12:00am Thursday-Sunday. The bar will specialize on delivering rotating affordable wine pours from around the world with the option of sampling paired meats and cheeses. We will focus on customer-service, complimented by a warm, unique, and inviting educational experience for those who wish to learn more about wine culture. In addition to our bar and food service, we also plan on supplementing our revenue by retailing wine, beer, cheese, salami and other related delectable dishes.

Minimal entertainment is planned. Our liquor license permits “two entertainers” which we plan on taking advantage of with sporadic unplugged local musical performances and dj’s to coincide with new wine releases or other special engagements. The entertainment will not be the feature, nor will it overpower casual conversation. Rather, it will complement the always relaxed ambiance.
 
We appreciate your consideration for Midtown’s latest gathering spot – Alley Wine!",Not only will the project demonstrate renovation of an existing otherwise obsolete generic structure (a brick 4-car garage) It will be a new concept of how we envision our neighborhoods. It will be a catalyst project for new neighborhood-scaled secondary network of commercial and walkable retail corridors. We intend on serving and hiring employees from the neighborhood.,"We are anticipating construction to begin in mid-2013. We've been working with the city and a local community development corporation to amend the local zoning designation in order to permit this unique concept to secure building permits. Architectural design has been completed, we're working on piecing together our financing. Once we've secured our zoning modification, we'll then be able to pull building permits and apply for our liquor license.",,,,12/21/12 10:04,Darin McLeskey,darinmcleskey@miufi.org,The Michigan Urban Farming Initiative - Brush Street Community Garden,"Our multi-phase project is centered around creating a demonstration urban farm on a block in the North End.

Depending on the timing of the funding, the sub-project would include either of two activites: the installation of a community plaza at the NW corner of the block, which involves brick pavers, a 12x20' stage platform, planters, window murals, and picnic tables, or the purchase of a storage shipping container and compost for our ""production plots"" west of Brush Street. The production plots will be open to community members on a first-come basis and MUFI will manage the unutilized plots. We want to provide the resources to produce crops and connections to sell them at nearby farmer's markets. Additional plans and budgets are available upon request.","Our organization's platform emphasizes involving the current Detroit community while bringing in new people and opening their eyes to the opportunities within the City. Our immediate neighbors are sparsely spaced, but remain very helpful and grateful that we're simply beautifying the area. Maintaining the land with rows of crops, ornamental flowers, and planters is obviously preferred over piles of trash and high weeds. In a larger context, neighborhood partners like Delores Bennett and the North End Youth Improvement Council have voiced the opportunity that our project would provide for employing and realigning the focus of the youth in the neighborhood. On a macro-economic scale, our project aims to be the seed germ of a newly emerging agriculture industry in this neighborhood, while orienting and attracting investors to restore nearby blighted buildings.","Either project would ideally be completed in late spring or early summer, contingent upon additional funding opportunities.

The state of Michigan has approximately a 16% food insecurity rate 22nd in the United States due impart to a high unemployment rate after the recession and a continually depressed manufacturing base. 
The mission of (Insert Name Here) is to develop a community of individuals who will bring about lasting social change to the human and food landscapes in which we move in and through each day. 

The way in which this will unfold is through an apprentice program for under-resourced youth age 16-24 where they will receive tuition-free culinary and food service training for up to one year and then be eligible to participate in an entrepreneurial incubator program upon graduation. 

This new initiative will serve the area of SE Michigan and the objectives will include;

We facilitate 4 to 5 local actors to perform 15-minute vignettes based on Shakespeare's comedies in children's hospitals, medical facilities, etc. They are long enough to grab the kids' attention, but short enough so that we don't lose them. The entertainment is a distraction for the patients or what I refer to as ""medicine for the heart"" administered by imagination. We give out Shakespeare-themed gifts after the performances that they can use during their chemotherapy or just take home and have fun with. The gifts range from coloring books to William Shakespeare finger puppets.","With the exclusion of various theater programs from schools in the community, the lack of Shakespeare in many cirriculums and the importance of art as a therapy, Shakespeare Against Cancer adds all of those factors to the community. 

Our recent performances include Children's Hospital of Michigan, Beaumont Children's Hospital and Oakwood Hospital's Center for Exceptional Families and the feedback we have received has not only been that the program helps brings smiles to the kids who are in those facilities battling several illnesses and challenges like cancer, but it may also be their first exposure to theater. It is also, many times, the first time their parents and the hospital's staff have been exposed to classic theater and Shakespeare.

The house is on the demolition list, but thanks to AJ O’Neil’s work with the City of Highland Park, they’re agreed to delay the demolition while we demonstrate the house’s potential. Jackson has been living in on Candler St. since the beginning of the summer, and organized for a group of students from Oberlin College to come out and begin work on the house, focusing on improving its exterior, securing it from intrusion, and helping develop the vision for its future. Dennis, Cameron, and Tony all stopped by early on, and kept coming back to lend their time, skills, and experience. AJ intends to live upstairs, allowing his work on solar streetlights in Highland Park to have a community headquarters. The rest will be converted into a community space and sustainability education center. It will feature affordable home sustainability measures and resources for people to find materials and upgrade their own homes. Other ideas for use of the space include a community library, meeting space, community garden and free store.","We will actively engage the community by inviting then into the center. Through the garden, meeting space, and library we’ll be creating community space and offering education on how people can improve their homes.. Energy generation, efficiency, water storage, recycling, and repurposing can effectively stem the outward flow of value from Highland Park through utility bills and building materials.

This building will interact with other sites in the Northpointe Neighborhood to develop opportunities and community – the St. Benedict’s Auditorium, which currently offers work space to Soulardarity, The Legacy News, Parole Probation Outreach, and Distributed Power, 116 Candler, a developing model of integrated sustainable renovation and urban farming, and the Northpointe Elementary School.

The goal is to build an example of what the local community can do to rebuild the city. We’re calling it the John R. House because, as we talk about the commercial redevelopment of the Woodward Ave. corridor, we want this model to be replicated, refined, and used to redevelop the John R. corridor into a model of sustainable communities. There are many small community developments along the John R. corridor – Candler St., Goldengate, Parkhurst, Montana – that have all encountered difficulties and could greatly benefit from collaboration, knowledge sharing, and a collective vision.","By the end of March, we can present a case to the city that the house is in good enough condition to be removed from the demolition list. We would be happy to share documentation of our progress as soon as the April SOUP, but you’ll also be welcome to follow our facebook page. The upstairs will be developed into a home through the spring, and AJ is hoping to move in as soon as possible. 

Several Oberlin students who worked on the project are interested in returning for the summer to continue the space’s development, so we’re aiming for a grand opening of the community space by August 2013, to which all of you are invited.","This money will be put to a specific purpose: Getting the John R. House off the demo list. Finishing the exterior work and making one room of the house livable will also someone to live on site and protect the project until AJ can move in full-time.

Participants figuratively banish the Nain Rouge, a folkloric imp who taunts Detroit, each year. In its fourth year, the parade runs through the cultural heart of Midtown Detroit, and the Marche organizers would like to add temporary public art installations along the parade route this year. Our goal is to enliven the experience for the Marche and Run du Nain Rouge participants. 

The Art du Marche project would commission artist Sarah Lapinski to install Nain Rouge themed installations in several areas along the 2013 Marche route. The mid-term goal of this Art du Marche installation is to create an annual art installation program as part of the Marche du Nain Rouge. Longer term goal is to have these installations become permanent along the parade route and eventually spread throughout Midtown.","The Marche’s goal is bring Detroit’s many people and communities together in an interactive Mardi-Gras esque parade. The Marche celebrates Detroit’s history, arts, and our culture in a creative way. Every participant is encouraged to actively engage in the parade’s street theatre. 

To further support community building efforts this year, the Marche is hosting post-Marche parties at several nearby bars and restaurants. We expect that these events will encourage our attendees to visit the businesses on or adjacent to the Marche route. The public art installations will help to change the perspectives that some participants may have of Detroit.","The fourth annual Marche du Nain Rouge will be held on March 24, 2013. If funded, the Art du Marche artwork will be installed prior to the parade. We would be excited to share the success of the project at your April or May Detroit SOUPs.",The Detroit SOUP award would allow the Marche du Nain Rouge organizers to commission Sarah Lapinski to complete multiple works of Nain Rouge inspired art and temporarily install them along the 2013 Marche route.2/2/13 23:29,Abida Blaze,abida_blaze@yahoo.com,Blazing Belly Dance Benefit for Interim House,"Blazing Belly Dance will host a benefit in April, 2013, for the YWCA Interim House, in Detroit.

I would like this project to help the Detroit community in two ways:
1) providing some cash to help Interim House with their immediate needs.
2) provide reference cards with emergency contact info/etc for the people.

Sidewalk’s mission is to promote visual and performing arts in Detroit by transforming public, unique and under-used property into non-traditional performance venues. Sidewalk stimulates pedestrian traffic in Metro-Detroit properties by re-purposing space for visual and performing arts. Sidewalk will be an annual event that promotes place-making and creative use of space in Detroit.

Sidewalk will present the work of a diverse collection of dance companies, theater troupes, musicians, and visual artists who are making work specifically informed by the landscape of our city.

The inaugural event will take place in the Brightmoor/Old Redford neighborhood of Detroit, August 3, 2013. We are largely collaborating with local artists, with a select number of special guests from out of state. Each performance will take place in a non-traditional space. The festival will feature discussion forums and 3-4 workshops with performing artists focusing on place-making, contact and site-specific improvisation, community theater, youth workshops and visual arts.

Sidewalk is inspired in part by Cape Town's ""Infecting the City Festival"" which has drawn thousands of people annually to site-specific performances in Cape Town.

This festival has great potential to grow into one of the most engaging, relevant and newsworthy arts festivals in Detroit.","Sidewalk will be the first festival of its kind in the United States to focus exclusively on the prolific work of site-specific performing artists. This project will bring the world of cutting edge, modern performing arts to ground level for everyday Detroiters. The residents of Brightmoor/Old Redford and all visitors to the area will receive exposure to the world of site-specific work in Detroit. It is a little know fact, that Detroit annually hosts several site-specific, pop-up performances of dance, music and theater. These performances tend to be inaccessible to the average Detroiter. Sidewalk will change that by bringing a number of relevant artists together, in a walkable, fun, festival environment.

Detroit is making world-wide headlines in regards to its artistic re-birth. Yet, this re-birth is largely centered around a select group of artists, while the average Detroiter has little to no opportunity to engage in this renaissance. This festival will bring new exposure regarding the arts and place-making to under-served Detroit neighborhoods.

Currently, Detroit is one the nation's most talked about cities, both for its growing reputation as a new hub for artists, but also because of economic and structural problems. This festival will be apart of the re-branding of Detroit in the eyes of its citizens and media as a beautiful and artistically engaging place. By literally making the landscape of our city essential to the performances, we generate new information to the public about the artistic and economic potential of Detroit.","Our inaugural event will take place on Saturday, August 3rd, 2013 and will continual annually. As long term attendees of Detroit Soup, we would be very excited to update the SOUP community on a regular, frequent basis. 

We will launch our brand and website at the end of March. Open call to artists and site-visits will commence in April. The festival program will be solidified mid-April - May. Major publicity will begin at the end of May.

I work out of the African Bead Museum serving Detroit's Premiere Ground Turkey Tacos. We have an outdoor stage, an art garden and much land. Unfortunately, the large stretch of land we have in uneven and the grass isn't lush. 

It's my vision that the grass be rehabbed so that movies can be shown on the grass in the warmer months, no cost to neighborhood children, teens and others. The grass could then be used for much more including soccer, yoga, and tai chi.

In closing, I propose that the good people of Detroit Soup and guests give this initiative a chance. The location is at Grand River & Grand BLVD. Visible from the main roads, freeway and a part of the Grand River Art Community.

Our organization focuses on improving the health and well-being of every Detroit resident through youth education, preventative health care, and awareness. We were formed in partnership with the National Prevention Strategy (NPS), which was commissioned by President Obama in the Affordable Care Act last year. The NPS is a comprehensive guidebook on how to shift the culture in America from focusing on disease and treatment to instead focus on healthy living and prevention. Over $15 billion dollars has been invested into programs implementing the NPS over the next ten years. By using the available federal funding, as well as other grants and donations, we believe we can truly create a healthy Detroit. We believe we can shift the culture in the city to center around healthy living. We want to start a movement in the city through awareness, public art, social media, etc. and get every healthy restaurant, business, and organization on board. Collaboration among anyone in the city working towards our common goal of a healthier and happier Detroit is key. Our plan includes redeveloping parks into neighborhood recreation centers, youth education programs in schools, city-wide youth athletic leagues, ""healthy business"" partnerships, and much more. I recently graduated from D:hive's BUILD course and have spent the last year and a half putting together this organization. Healthy Detroit has grown faster than I ever imagined, and we recently found out we are being featured in the US Surgeon General's Annual Status Report to Congress!","As Detroit continues to make headlines worldwide for its historic comeback, we have reached one of the most important eras in our city’s rich history.

We believe this is a great tool for residents to learn about all the healthy places to check out in the city, as well as gain some insight on healthy living. Additionally, it would allow us the ability to create a database (with mobile access) of all the healthy restaurants/businesses in the city.

Born and raised in Michigan and continuing to call the Great Lakes State home, I always keep an eye out for Michigan artists in the blogs and publications I read. Unfortunately, I often find the stories of Michigan artists untold and unacknowledged. Detroiters have their own unique approach to creating, and I think now is as an important time as ever to celebrate and dialogue about that approach.

I have had some of the most profound conversations with internationally known artists while they were visiting Detroit, as well as high schoolers that call Detroit home. No matter the medium, skill level, age, gender, economic background, etc., every artist has a story. I want to start a video journal that allows Detroit creatives to tell their stories. I want to create a video experience that, while serving as a platform to learn about an artist and their work, can stand alone as a work of art itself. These short (2-5min) video experiences will be shot and edited in a professional manner, and with an artistic style and aesthetic. 

I have already begun to identify Detroit creatives, and would like for this project to be extremely collaborative. I will ask each featured artist to suggest members of the community whose creative processes they would like to learn more about. By making these videos available on one website, I am hoping to increase access and exposure to Detroit's arts and culture scene. This project is aimed at enhancing Detroit's arts and culture networks and contributing to increased understanding and collaborations amongst the city's creatives.","This project matters to the Detroit community because it gives us an opportunity to share with the world the stories of our working artists and creative practitioners. What better way to communicate the importance of the arts than by showcasing how the arts are alive and thriving in our very own community? This is a story about us, told by us. Too often, Detroit artists are overshadowed by images of blight and headlines about our politics. We can't rely on outsiders to tell our stories for us.

We could serve the same food on white tablecloths and keep our donations to ourselves, but that would feel soulless. Instead we’re focused on the kind of community that’s built by sharing a meal, a space, or an experience.” Anthony Myint Mission Street Food

The state of Michigan has had approximately a 16% food insecurity rate, 22nd in the United States, due in part to a high unemployment rate after the recession and a continually depressed manufacturing base. 

The mission is to develop a community of individuals who will bring about lasting social change to the human and food landscapes in which we move in and through each day. 

The way in which this will unfold is through an apprentice program for under-resourced youth, age 16-24, where they will receive tuition-free culinary and food service training, for up to one year, and then be eligible to participate in an entrepreneurial incubator program upon graduation. This new initiative will serve the area of SE Michigan and the objectives will include:
•a mobile community café
•an apprenticeship program in the hospitality industry for under-resourced youth age 16-24
•citizen engagement through various outreach efforts
•raising necessary funds and in-kind donations to launch start-up of said nonprofit from community members and friends of (Insert Name Here) 
•continual special events; festivals, conferences, benefits and other programing to engage public discourse 

We will operate with as many options as possible to eat with dignity serving rustic style pizza, calzones, focaccia, soups, and salads and pressed sandwiches. Prices will range from $5 to $10 featuring local, seasonal, organically grown produce dairy, meats and vegetables. Fresh herbs, ground spices and fair trade tea and micro brewed soda will also be served. We will use zero waste plant based service products as well. 

The start-up cost will be $55,000. The majority of the initial expense will be the outfitting / manufacturing of the food trailer being $48,817. The remainder will be from the start-up of a typical nonprofit/restaurant; initial food costs, paper products, office supplies, kitchen equipment, permits, licenses, etc. Initial fundraising will be through individual donations and e a crowdsourcing campaign i.e. Kickstarter. 

We will establish an effective mix of vending locations throughout the area so we plant ourselves in the community we’re vending. This will take place by partnering with established organizations, both religious and civic, as well as nonprofits so we can naturally access their existing networks. 

The management team consists of a board of directors and an executive director, which will be its only salaried employee at the time of launch. Other positions will consist of volunteers, independent contractors, in-kind services, and pro-bono workers.

We are considered the grassroots effort of the COMPSTAT program ran by the Wayne State Police whom we work with and are fully supported by (null financially). To the residents we organize with, we offer many safety resources such as Twin-Hook Club Locks for the steering wheel of automobiles, home safety assessments where we survey the home and provide alarms, dead bolt locks (w/ installation) outdoor lighting & all materials needed for neighborhood clean-up and board-up projects. All of our resources are free to residents. VIN Etch the Block would be another resource we would provide free of charge to residents.","Through the COMPSTAT program that is a live crime mapping, we are able to know what crimes happen, where they happen & how frequently they happen.

It also would have a positive impact in the wallet of man residents. One of Detroit residents largest bills is their auto insurance & many auto insurance agencies lower the costs when a car is VIN etched because there is less risk involved.","We would be able to order a VIN etching machine immediately after receiving funds. We are in contact with residents on a daily basis and many have expressed interest in VIN etching & we are positive that it would be a popular resource for many Detroiters.

These services are available to a previously underserved population of adult learners: low-income or underemployed persons over 19 years of age. The goal of the Learning Lab is twofold: to provide much needed educational resources in order to obtain the highest level of education desired and readying our clients to secure steady jobs that allow for advancement. Our desire is to equip our clients with the education and skills necessary to self determine their lives in the workforce. In order to do this we need to incorporate more and sophisticated technology to encourage a familiarity and mastery of technological skills. Not only is it technological skill necessary to even look for a job nowadays but as of next year the GED test will be completely computerized and online. In order to continue provide the best services we can to fulfill our mission, we must incorporate technology into all of our programming and offer better and more computer literacy classes.


We are already doing things to prepare our clients for the world of technology. The bulk of the space in the Learning Lab is occupied by 21 computer stations. There is a heavy emphasis on internet usage and email training in the workforce development classes. We also have computer software such as Rosetta Stone and Skills Tutor and we incorporate the usage of the internet when possible in lesson plans. However, this is no sufficient. We lack the proper tools to easily integrate technology into our teaching methods. 


This is why we desperately need a Promethean Board!!!! Promethean boards are becoming widely used in schools, including DPS. It would allow us to easily integrate computer and internet skills training into every lesson and class we provide. It would allow us to more easily teach typing classes and basic computer skills, by modeling at a class as opposed to an individual level. Furthermore, it would provide an easy platform through which to introduce new typing software, and new GED prep software, that we would also use SOUP funds to purchase. 


http://www.swsol.org/adult_learning_lab","The Southwest Solutions Learning Lab primarily serves the community in Southwest Detroit. According to a map from Data Driven Detroit, 46.9-100% of this population has no High School Diploma or GED. (http://datadrivendetroit.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/PctPop25PlusNoHSDip08BGMajRoads.pdf). To compound on this issue “less than 40 percent of households (in Detroit) have broadband access.” (http://www.knightfoundation.org/blogs/knightblog/2012/4/5/five-lessons-bridging-digital-divide/) This is a significant issue when remembering the transfomration of the GED in 2014, to be completely digital. It would appear that gaining the GED for many Detroit residents will become increasingly difficult with no access to internet in their homes. There is some hope! The Knight Foundation’s reports on their efforts to close the digital divide, have shown that computer classes at libraries have made a significant impact on participants’ willingness and ability to use the internet. (http://www.knightfoundation.org/blogs/knightblog/2012/4/5/five-lessons-bridging-digital-divide/) However, the largely immigrant community that we serve are not connected to such municipal services like the library system. This digital divide, disconnection from relevant municipal services, and the changing nature of the GED will marginalize many in our community. That is why the transformation and betterment of the Learning Lab, with modern technological teaching tools is integral to the neighborhoods in Southwest. 

Closing the digital and educational divide in the community of Southwest Detroit is a good in and of itself, but it is also important when considering Detroit as an integrated whole. As the organization Global Detroit has studied and reported on, immigrant populations are essential to major metropolises’ economic and population growth and vitality. Immigrants are more likely to start businesses and have a disproportionately high rate of patents for inventions. Thus, healthy and well served Southwest communities are relevant to the self-interest of a post-industrial Detroit that is in transition to a new economy.

This initiative will enable a new camp to be established from an organization called Royal Family Kids Camp, which already has 180 camp locations around the United States. 

The project involves using 20 story-telling photo shoots to bring foster children’s stories to the general public. Through video and photography promotions, we are telling the stories of children going through the foster care system, and why this camp and year-round mentoring program makes an impact on these children. This project will enable 30 kids to attend camp in its first year and send them home with hope, determination, and love.

Beyond funding this camp, we hope to inspire others to partake in camps/opportunities local to them, and to become educated on the foster and adoption systems. This project originated from the mind of photographer Rob Woodcox, after a week of counseling at an already existing foster care camp. After experiencing the difference one week of camp could make with his two campers, and having been rescued through adoption himself, Rob had to do something with his talent to bring this opportunity to the greater public eye. After pitching this idea to his creative partners Jakob Skogheim (Filmmaker) and Tabbatha Plomaritas (Producer), the three began developing the campaign with diligence and determination. Soon it was clear that more help would be needed, and Casey Maxwell (Graphic Designer) and Aubrey Warner (Writer) joined the team.","This project is extremely important to the Detroit community. The new location of Royal Family Kids Camp will draw kids from foster systems in Wayne and Washtenaw counties. Often children that come out of the foster care system without support end up homeless or on government aid. We have the opportunity to provide them with the encouragement and support they need, ultimately providing hope for their future.","Our project is currently live on Indiegogo.com, and will run until April 23rd. This is a fully developed and progressing project, that simply needs support at this point. You can see our campaign page here to see some of the art that has been created to tell foster kids' stories, and learn more: http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/stories-worth-telling

If selected as a funded project, I (Rob) would love to return to SOUP after the completion of this project to report the final income, how the creation of art has panned out, and how far the total funds reach! As part of our perk structure on Indiegogo, when different levels of donation are made, the contributors can receive perks, or recognition. As part of a thank you to SOUP, you would be included in the book we're creating out of this project, and marketed at our celebration party at Photo Studio Group in Ann Arbor.

Through studying the food distribution industry of Detroit this project has developed a particular focus on mobile food vending. Detroit Food trust is a small scale installation project that distributes to areas that typically do not have an abundance of healthy food. The honor system is used to sustain this project and it is essentially a nonprofit organization. Each user pays what he or she thinks the item is worth and decides whether to trust the system. The flexibility of this project starts to question why Detroit makes it so hard for individuals (mobile food trucks/mobile vendors) to distribute food. Through Codes and Compliance's each vendor of Detroit has to abide by strict government policy, which deliberately says you cannot sell food (a human necessity) in a certain area. For every law there is reason, but some don’t cut to the chase. Detroit Food Trust has become a creative project that pushes the boundaries of food distribution within the city of Detroit.","Detroit Food Trust, if funded, will help serve Detroit and the people who need fresh and healthy food in their neighborhoods. The localization of this project lets people who are in food rich areas supply the people who suffer from food scarcity in others. The idea of this project and how it would support the community of Detroit is to install a series of vendors at various locations according to DDOT bus stops and schedules. The point in doing this is to use the existing infrastructure of the bus system, and the people of Detroit to sustain the function of this project. If Detroit Food Trust can gain the trust of its community, the city itself can potentially help distribute food to areas that have a scarce amount of resources.",The duration of this project will be continued throughout the rest of this upcoming summer. Estimated time for this project will be from present to August 28th.

I want others to be able to look in to each persons eyes and realize that they have a story to tell. From the stories I have collected so far I have learned that most want to do better but don't know how to get the help that they need nor do they have a support system. The photographs and stories would be put together in a book with the end goal of having a gallery event to release the book. The connecting agent aspect of the project would be to connect each person to a partnering non-profit or resources in order to allow them the help they need.","The project matters because I feel the only way to break stereotypes is to start a conversation and allow people to have knew thoughts. I believe that to build a stronger community we all have to recognize each other as our neighbors and be willing to reach out and assist people who may need help. The project also functions as a way to educate the community but also each person I talk to. Most people that I have talked to don't know where to go to get help or that they even can get help. By teaching even just one person, that person is now empowered to be a changing force and can now teach others around him.",The time frame of the project would be four months to compile the book and release it--however with a never ending time frame in regards to connecting people with opportunities. I would be able to share at an upcoming SOUP the progress I have made by sharing the stories and photos I have collected and how each person was helped.,"I would use the SOUP grant funding towards the printing, publishing and design of the project and also if needed to connect each person with an opportunity.",Detroit SOUP (May 5 Jam Handy::2900 E.

As a result, they are less likely to succeed academically, more likely to drop out of school, and even more likely to find trouble with the law. When we as parents, pastors, school officials, and community leaders in Brightmoor heard this statistic we were appalled. We cannot afford to have more of our children undereducated and underprepared for the future. We refuse to fail another generation of our youth. As a result, we have been working for the past six months to create community awareness around this issue and to ultimately, find effective solutions to turn the tide. Our campaign is called “Present! In Brightmoor: Our School Attendance Movement”. 


Our organization, the Brightmoor Pastor Alliance, working with pastors, parents, and lay leaders in Brightmoor have tirelessly researched possible ways we,as a community, can intervene to get our children to school, on time, everyday. 


Based on the work of Dr. Robert Balfanz of Johns Hopkins University, one of the leading scholars on school attendance, we have identified intervention models located in Baltimore, that we sincerely believe would dramatically benefit our community work confronting this issue.The programs, called School Everyday and The Baltimore Student Attendance Campaign, have implemented community driven initiatives that impact student attendance. Logically, given the stark similarity between Detroit and Baltimore, we believe this model could produce similar successful outcomes in Brightmoor. 


However, to truly understand how to implement these initiatives we are going to Baltimore to tour the programs ,to meet with their leadership,and to motivate and inspire our leadership by the success and strength of education organizing in Baltimore. 


We have selected 30 community representatives from each stakeholder group including youth, parents, organizational members, and school officials that will travel to Baltimore to conduct an assessment of School Everyday and The Baltimore Student Attendance Campaign. Our goal will be to go in late May and begin an organizing campaign this fall to address school attendance.","This project matters because the issue of school attendance is one that impacts all of Detroit’s children. Additionally, it is an issue that communities, given the right tools and strategies, can have great impact thus, giving young people a better chance of success. If Brightmoor can create a model for communities organizing to solve the issue of school attendance than we can then be a model and resource to help other Detroit neighborhoods.","We are hoping to visit Baltimore May 29-June 2nd. We would need to get the complete funding before we leave on the 29th. We would be able to bring back video, stories, and pictures to a subsequent soup to update the group on our trip and our organizing.","In order to take 20-30 stakeholders to Baltimore it will cost 7500 dollars. Excellent Schools Detroit is donating 2100. However, we are still short 5400 dollars (250 dollars per person). We are actively fundraising since our small organizations, churches, and members are not able to bear the financial burden of the trip.

We currently visit local hospitals and perform for children during or prior to their chemotherapy and other treatments. After the performances we provide them with Shakespeare-themed gifts that range from Shakespeare finger puppets and flash cards to coloring books and crayons that they can use during their treatments.

In many cases, our program is the first time a lot of the kids -- in addition to their parents and sometimes staff -- have engaged with Willy Shakes and live theater. Tammy Morris, clinical program manager at Oakwood Center for Exceptional Families, explained her experience with our program in the April edition of Metro Parent magazine this way, ""The performance brought our patients and families together, offered them something new – and I was overjoyed to see some of our more severely involved patients paying keen attention throughout the entire performance.""","Several key programs have been cut from Detroit Public Schools and other districts due to finanical deficits. These include culinary projects, but it also includes the arts -- theater, drama, glee club, painting and many others. Shakespeare Against Cancer, although the circumstances are not ideal, gives families an alternative to those missing educational assets by, hopefully, planting a seed that will create healthy, adult theater patrons who will support venues like Fisher Theatre, Fox Theatre, The Detroit Opera House and other arts venues in the city in the future. 

The arts a a key element to creating a thriving, economically-stable city (and state).

Current stats published by Arts Serve Mich: Annual expenditures by the creative community in Michigan are $553,599,668 that goes directly into the local economy according to ArtServe Michgan’s analysis of the 2010 fiscal year. More than $2 billion dollars is spent on the arts for tourism. The creative community also accounts for 22, 335 jobs with salaries amounting up to $193, 987, 699 annually.

The emerging writers and artists published in this creative arts anthology are participants in Racquet Up Detroit (RUD). RUD is an out-of-school youth development program that combines the sport of squash, in combination with literacy instruction, academic support, community service, and mentoring to make a difference in the lives of Detroit youth. RUD launched in January 2011 with the help of the National Urban Squash and Education Association (NUSEA), and is a non-profit organization with 4 staff and over 50 active volunteers.
 As part of its literacy instruction, Racquet Up Detroit seeks to offer authentic literacy experiences for its middle-school participants. RUD holds an annual Open Mic Night where students perform and showcase their talents. Students have participated in workshops taught by members of Citywide Poets, an exclusive group of Detroit youth poets, and learned writing skills from a creative writing instructor at the University of Michigan. RUD’s believes students have a voice and that voice deserves to be heard.
 This is a student-driven book, from the title that was collaborative chosen, to the pieces individually selected and edited. My Life, My Words is the second annual anthology, and RUD plans to increase publication to 300 copies. With more excitement and student work, this year’s anthology will increase from 52 pages to over 60. The glossy, two-color cover will again hold artwork, poems, essays, comics, and stories from 40 program participants. This anthology is then shared with members of RUD’s wide community. From teachers at partner schools to student friends and families, this book will leave an impact.","This project allows the voices and opinions of Detroit youth to be expressed in a professional and exciting format that will be shared with a variety of audiences. This book promotes a positive view of Detroit youth by highlighting their creative talents. Detroit is home to countless talented writers and artists, and RUD seeks to keep that tradition alive. Fostering interest in the creative arts at a young age is critical to promoting awareness of these career options.
 This book is an achievement that students can reference for high school and college applications. In addition, seeing their work published will spark talented artists and writers to continue pursuing their craft by entering writing contests, performing at local literary events, and seeking opportunities for arts education. Being included in a professionally designed and published book allows students to feel like accomplished authors and emerging artists.
 In addition, My Life, My Words is a collection of work firmly grounded in Racquet Up Detroit. In poems and art, students reference their teammates, they recount a special squash trip, and plan ahead for their bright futures. This volume is a tightly-crafted, coherent look into the lives of 40 Detroit youth. RUD operates at the Northwest Activities Center, and has a footprint of friends, families, volunteers, and school partners in the Northwest Detroit community.","All material, including essays, poems, artwork, and comics, was collated and sent to our graphic designer. The graphic designer is currently laying out the book, and expects completion in mid-June. 
 Last year, RUD sent the completed book file to the printer on May 17, and received the books on June 5. This year, the schedule was pushed back. An initial estimate from the graphic designer says RUD will receive the completed books around Thursday, July 4.
 This is a realistic target, and one that works well for both Racquet Up Detroit and Detroit SOUP. Monday, July 15 is the start of Racquet Up Detroit’s Summer Slam camp. This camp brings together all students, volunteers, staff, and families, and is an exciting time to launch the book. 
 In addition, with a short time-frame, RUD has the ability to present at a Detroit SOUP event in July or August. RUD hopes that students will be able to perform selections from My Life, My Words at an upcoming Detroit SOUP event. This gives our students valuable experience performing in front of a crowd, and provides Detroit SOUP with a hands-on view of Detroit young artists. RUD will also provide Detroit SOUP with copies of the book, and it will be a lasting artifact that highlights the importance of Detroit SOUP’s work to foster creative arts in Detroit.","SOUP grant funding will be used to pay for the publication of the book. RUD publishes with Color House Graphics, a Grand Rapids-based book manufacturing company. Last year, RUD published 210 books, and had them shipped to Detroit, for a total cost of $412.88. This year, RUD requests $700.00 to cover book publication. This cost increase represents publishing more copies, and the increased length of the book. 
 A friend of Racquet Up Detroit generously designs the book pro-bono. She is an accomplished graphic designer, and works with InsideOut Literary Arts Project to design their collections of student work. 
 With any excess funds, RUD will hold a Book Release Party, allowing students to share the enjoyment and excitement of publishing with friends and family.",Youth SOUP (Glearners Community Food Bank)5/28/13 18:47,Chris Norris,chris.norris93@yahoo.com,I'm going to College,The project benefits Detroit Brightmoor middle school youth by placing them with peer mentors who have made it through high school and have been or are successful in their college careers.

The focuses in this project are:
 • community engagement and creative place-making
 • youth development
 • quality of life upgrades to neighborhood including green space and bus stop seating
 • beautification and place-making through fine art, digital art, and participatory performance 

Finite 7 will operate in 3 Phases.

Phase 1: Community Clean-up & Building the Edible Art Installation and Bus Stop Seating

Phase 2: Planting + Performing in the Edible Art Installation and, Bus Stop Seating Installation 

Phase 3: Community Solar Light Installation, Winter Prep, Participatory Performances

September-November 2013 - Artists lead youth and volunteers in a day of hand-crafting 6in x 6in solar light cubes from wood and plexi-glass, and securing the solar light cubes to the perimeter of the vacant lot. 

The lights will illuminate the shrubbery, the bus stops, and the block in which there is currently no City-installed street light at all.

Our project brings visual and performance art, functional art (garden installation and bus stop seating), green space, and opportunities for fresh food directly to our neighborhood. 

The project directly benefits Detroit youth living in the neighborhood (approximately 1,000 youth) and the youth we instruct at the Finite Studios arts programs (approximately 20 youth), through enhancement of physical environment and opportunities for arts and environmental justice enrichment. 

The project also directly benefits the students in which artist Maya Stovall works with at her Detroit Future Schools artist residency (approximately 30 youth) through field trip, summer intensive, and workshop opportunities associated with the Installation.

(Math and Manufacturing), the Arts, the World (local and global), and Health Studies to help them develop 21st Century skills for the classroom and the workforce while they play. It is a ""hands-on, minds-on"" interactive experience, both on-site and through community outreach programs that engage children to learn about various subjects and the world around them.

Imaginosity is influenced by other renowned centers such as Chicago, Boston, St. Louis, Pittsburgh and Houston. Houston is mentoring our group as we press forward with this exceptional center. Houston, itself, has a high poverty and illiteracy rate - both reading and financial.

The Center's mission is ""to inspire a lifelong love of learning through the power of play."" Our goal is to create a welcoming, fun, and entertaining environment which helps spark learning through imagination, curiosity, and discovery. Our exhibits, both inside and outside, will be broad-based to include subjects in science, technology, engineering, math, manufacturing, art, music, drama, design, literature, culture, economics, health, fitness, geography, and history","With almost 36% of Metro Detroit students failing to graduate on time or choosing to drop out, and more than 500,000 Michigan children living below the poverty line (Annie E. Casey Foundation), it is extremely important that Imaginosity Discovery Center's mission to create ""a lifelong love of learning"" for children age 12 and younger is realized and quickly! 

Now more than ever, children need a chance at a future where the effects of poverty are minimized, families need a place to enjoy quality time together, and each child deserves an equal opportunity where they can experience the joy of learning and gain the skills that they will need to be successful in life.

The center will help to create a better educated generation through innovative exhibits and programming while helping to also provide influence in the school district, which will in turn, help to break the detrimental cycle of poverty that many children in Detroit and the region find themselves in. The effects of poverty are staggering -- more than 40% of preschoolers are not ready for kindergarten. That delay compounds itself until high school seniors are actually only passing school at a ninth grade level.

The center will have exhibits and galleries that provide full exposure to the Arts as well as Physical Fitness - two areas which are being severely underfunded at the State and Federal levels in our education system. Imaginosity will also help provide financial literacy and civic understanding to its young visitors through innovative activities and programming in its 'KidTroit' exhibit gallery, which will be a fully interactive, sophisticated city based on many of Detroit's beloved companies and services.","Our ""traveling"" experience starts in September 2013.

These exhibits will be science and/or artistic based that children can use and allow their imaginations to inspire the creation and execution of many of the activities.

Its greater downtown is beautiful and grand and I was surprised to find out that the city is facing a lot of the same problems Detroit is - high downtown vacancy and disinvestment in the urban core. Why does it look so much better than ours then? It's because even though some buildings were vacant, they were not graffitied and boarded up, like many of ours. I can't do anything about the boarding up, but I can help get rid of graffiti by supplying a reasonably-priced graffiti removal service to Detroit.

I use an environmentally-friendly chemical system that is safe for historic buildings; it unbinds the paint from the surface so that the paint can simply be washed away, instead of blasting it off, which is terrible for old buildings. The product is 100% biodegradable. It is made in America.","Detroit doesn't have many options for graffiti removal. There are some suburb-based services but they mostly rely on abrasive techniques that damage historic buildings. They are also more expensive. I know residents with graffiti-covered buildings that are at a loss about what to do. I can help them and give them the option to remove the graffiti.

I would also commit to clean up community parks for free or at extremely discounted costs. I live in Woodbridge and Scripps Park is covered with graffiti - it makes it a much less welcoming environment.

2) the number of voters in our target who actually vote
3) our social media presence and increased number of engaged Detroiters
4) tracking our website traffic

Those are all tangible number that we can use to talk about success at upcoming soup events.","To be successful, an awareness campaign needs to have overwhelming on-the-ground visibility. Vote Detroit has partnered with some of the community groups and organizations in which city residents participate and the businesses at which city residents eat, work, shop and play.

As the weather permits, students will mostly be on location interviewing, filming, writing and selling self-produced products at Chene Park ,Hart Plaza downtown and the Detroit 48205 ""Osborn"" zone. Our goal is to engage, enlighten and empower by providing training and employment. Placement is determined through a series of tests and evaluations We will provide a review and assessment to determine the passion of each student. Afterwards, we will encourage the student to move forward in the area they are most talented.Categories include but are not limited to: Video production, Social networking, Marketing, Creative Writing, Printing/T-Shirt Screening.","Key Way to Kids is committed to training and employing 15 youths ages (8-18) from the Detroit 48205 ""Osborn"" zone. As this area was recently negatively deemed by the media as the worst, most dangerous, crime ridden neighborhood in the nation, community outreach is desperately needed. We believe these are bright children, yet capable of exceeding stereo-types given the right tools like a little guidance, and inspiration coupled with technical training. Children learn by example, seeing their peers positively defy the daily pressures and threats of street-life by embracing creative alternatives is a guaranteed win, even if only one Detroit city block at a time.","The ""Summer Job Youth-Apprenticeship"" project running now until mid-August 2013, will convert back to the ""Youth-Apprentice"" After-School program once school is back in session 2013-2014 and will continue each year, closing the gap on children otherwise left unsupervised giving in to peer-pressure and detriment. 

The ""Shoot Films Not People Detroit"" is a major component of the Youth Media Arts Film Festival target date September 2013. This festival will showcase talented young filmmakers and their works of art. 

To share about the project as an upcoming Soup, the students would produce a mini-film demonstrating the program's direct effectiveness and would also promote the SOUP at events as well as via uploading the film to all available social media outlets. (Twitter, Linked-In, Facebook, YouTube, Google-Share) and more.

In an effort to help revitalize our neighborhood, Mack Avenue Community Church - a local community of faith where nearly every member lives in the local community - sponsored a 3v3 basketball tournament and welded hoops permanently to previously abandoned spaces. MACC Development - a community development corporation in which I serve as Executive Director - helped establish a sports league for more than 100 local youth. 

These efforts have beautified a central space and contributed to healthy, constructive activity for my family and my neighbors. But there's more work to be done. Nearly 30% of homes are visibly vacant and dilapidated, and dozens of vacant lots litter the neighborhood, discouraging residents from remaining, and encouraging petty crime, trespassing, and vandalism.

Introducing the B3, or Building Better Blocks, events. These are locally-organized community clean ups that partner large volunteer teams with local residents. This summer, we've maintained the entire Pingree Park space, cleaned multiple nearby playgrounds, cleared over a dozen vacant lots, and boarded several dangerous, abandoned homes. 

During these events, local residents and greater-Detroit volunteers are partnered with a residential ""Block Captain"" that designs a project and leads her volunteer team in the implementation of that project. The effort is dignifying, creates and obvious and immediate effect, and facilitates meaningful cross-cultural interaction for the benefit of all involved.","B3 events drive to the hear of community development and neighborhood-based solutions. On a theoretical level, these events are unique blending of internal and external resources, combining the willingness of local and non-local volunteers with the experience and leadership of residents to tackle otherwise exhausting tasks. At a practical level, every lot and home maintained, every public space cleaned, discourages criminal activity and creates a safer, beautiful environment for residents. Finally, at a community level, the sweeping success of these events catalyzes otherwise frustrated residents; it rallies communities to engage difficult challenges. The success is not only for the moment, then, but a reservoir of hope to be drawn from for inevitable upcoming challenges. 

We are not turning my community and its residents into ""a project"" - we are challenging stereotypes, beautifying my neighborhood, and empowering local leaders to spearhead change from block to block.","We conduct most B3 events during the summer months, and usually conduct anywhere between six and ten every season. 

I would be glad to share about B3 and its effects. I recognize that SOUP does not prefer media presentations, and would be glad to adjust my presentation as needed.","B3 events do not only require hard work from neighbors of all kinds. They require access to reliable tools, reusable and non-reusable supplies, and funding to compensate - at three to the four times Michigan's minimum wage - the professional efforts of community in engaging the most challenging of tasks. 

The SOUP grant, if received, could double our equipment totals of riding lawn mowers, weed whackers, trimmers, edgers and more. More importantly, remaining funding could be invested toward the long-term goal of establishing a landscaping company managed by local neighbors eager for honest work.",Detroit SOUP (Jam Handy)7/2/13 0:16,Natalie Lombardo,rockthestrokenat@gmail.com,Rock the Stroke,"Dear SOUP members,

I am creating a nonprofit organization called Rock the Stroke, starting with a website called rockthstroke.com. This website will be an energetic, educational and supportive resource for young stroke survivors from the metro Detroit area and across the U.S. I am a former newspaper journalist and a current legal writer and blogger from Ferndale. I am taking my writing skills and pouring them into this project to share what I've learned caring for a young stroke survivor, and to reach out to others in the community to continue learning.

My partner, Drew Podgorski, had a severe spinal stroke in December 2010 at the age of 29. He was paralyzed on his right side, and lost the ability to walk, bladder and bowel function and sensation from his chest down.

As his primary caregiver, I dedicated my life to helping Drew get back on his feet and find the help he needed to heal and recover, including seeking legal help to navigate the complicated Medicaid system, practicing Eastern medicine like acupuncture and medical yoga, trying experimental bladder surgeries and getting him into cutting edge therapy programs. It took Drew and I years to find some of his treatments, and we are still in the thick of his recovery. 

Currently, there's virtually nothing on the Internet for young stroke survivors. Rockthestroke.com will share what we're learning on this earth shattering, beautiful journey. I'm also reaching out to the stroke survivor community and having doctors, experts and healers contribute their knowledge. In addition, I'm interviewing stroke survivors and sharing their courageous stories. 

When Drew first had his stroke, I felt like I was the only woman in the world with a loved one's stroke recovery on my shoulders at such a young age. It was lonely and confusing, and I had no fellow caregivers or inspiring young stroke survivors to turn to.

But in this process, I'm helping build a welcoming community where survivors and their caregivers can support and learn from one another - and see each other doing amazing things that they thought were a thing of the past. For instance, where Drew couldn't walk, go to the bathroom, or feed himself before, now he is riding his tricked-out trike, working as a creative video editor and playing guitar in his punk band Size Queen.

Rock the Stroke signifies youth, strength and rocking a positive, active future despite these life changing strokes that are all too common in young people. 

Aside from rockthestroke.com, I also plan to lead a metro Detroit support group for young stroke survivors who come together on the website, and through local hospitals. The third tier of Rock the Stroke would be speaking in metro Detroit schools about stroke risk and recovery, to work toward stroke prevention and education.","Strokes are one of the leading causes of death in the U.S. They can and do occur at any age. Nearly one fourth (198,750) of strokes occur in people under the age of 65 each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In Wayne County, the age-adjusted five year mortality rate for stroke is nearly 50 percent, according to the Michigan Department of Community Health. These statistics show that a quarter of strokes are occurring in young people, and in Wayne County, only half of stroke victims survive. 

Young stroke survivors have better recoveries, and are more likely to get back into the workforce and lead productive lives, compared to stroke survivors who are seniors. But they need each other to thrive and take those first steps. In metro Detroit, there are many young stroke survivors who are blowing their disabilities out of the water and contributing to the community. Their stories need to be told and built upon.

Local rockthstroke.com contributors include stroke survivors Drew Podgorski, a musician and video artist; Tony DeNardo, bass player of the world-renowned Muggs and Jonathan Parks, a motivational speaker for under privileged Detroit youth and beaming new father. These survivors are just the trip of the ice berg. Many metro Detroit healers and doctors are also contributing.

My goal is to reach out to young stroke survivors and their caregivers through this collaborative website. I also aim to build and run support groups for metro Detroit survivors as a platform to lean on each other, have fun and share healing tips. 

The third tier of Rock the Stroke would be speaking in metro Detroit schools about stroke risk and recovery, to work toward stroke prevention and education.","I would like to have rockthestroke.com live within six months. I currently have about 50 articles written, I've interviewed about 15 survivors, and I have several healers working on their pieces. My web developer is in the process of building this website.

I could share details about my project via PowerPoint presentation, and by having the aforementioned stroke survivors share their success stories and contribution to the site. We are rocking the stroke and we want to help others rock it too!

Thank you kindly for your consideration and all of the work you're doing to help Detroiters.","If I were to receive SOUP grant funding, I would use it to pay my web developer to build rockthestroke.com. I would also use it to help pay for the fees for registering rockthestroke.com as a 501c3. If there is any money left over, I would save some for Internet ads to promote the site and marketing vehicles such as PRWeb. I would also start a fund for support group expenses, such as activities, refreshments and meeting places.

Artists’ workshops will engage students in the following art disciplines: ceramics, drawing, fiber, mixed media, painting, and photography. A booklet will be created at the end of the year featuring student artwork. Students will also exhibit and sell work at our Annual Student Show.","Detroit is a city rich in culture and imagination. Our history has proven us to be a people who overcome and a people who cultivate life and beauty out things that are dead and ashen. We have birthed musical geniuses, daring artists, and out-of-the-box creative writers. The arts have played a major role in the restoration and revival of major cities throughout the world, so why not Detroit?

Live Coal Gallery exists to be a vibrant museum and gallery that fosters a passion for art, community, and learning by collecting, exhibiting, and selling the works of aspiring, emerging, and established artists. We provide mentoring opportunities for Detroit high school students, conduct workshops for children and families, and collaborate with local businesses, organizations, and schools on community art projects. Our special exhibitions feature the works of artists who have never been in shows to those who are recognized internationally. Our permanent collection is a reflection of Detroit’s versatile community of artists.

Live Coal Gallery’s vision is to house the largest permanent collection of artwork created by Detroit youth (with an emphasis on high school students) and become a model for art mentoring programs. Our connection with the Detroit Public Schools’ Fine Arts Department will provide the means to reach hundreds of youth who will receive instruction and mentoring from Detroit’s emerging and established artists. Our Aspiring Artists Members will have an amazing experience working one on one with professional artists while creating original works of art and learn about presenting work professionally, developing a competitive portfolio, and marketing their work. As we reach out, LCG will become an invaluable resource and creative hub for Detroit youth and the wider community.","The project commences on September 1, 2013 and ends in June 30, 2014. Since we have not actually started the program, we could share about our museum in general and bring photos showing our space as well as our upcoming community mural project which runs from July 22-July 24th. The project involves working with about a dozen high school students on a mural installation located at Trumbull and Merrick in the Historic Woodbridge Neighborhood. This would give guests a chance to witness one of the ways we collaborate with local organizations and involve Detroit youth.","The budget for our artist-in-residence program is $16,320.00. LCG is requesting funds from SOUP to help towards purchasing art materials and supplies for the program. Our art supplies budget is $3,000. Residencies would be in approximately three schools.

My plan is to apply specific strategies in the local community in order to further unite the community and decrease the levels of crime and violence. The stategies cover multiple community issues such as food (growing your own), shelter (gradual purchase of tax properties and creation of a community house), transportation (community shuttle bus/van), and necessary life skills such as self-esteem, motivation, and purpose. My plan includes the creation of a community house, warming centers, regular educational workshops, and regular distribution of educational/inspirational materials to assist people in finding their life's purpose and passion, and pursuing it. People who find meaning in their lives and who are actively engaged in something they find worthwhile are very unlikely to steal or become violent.","I believe this project is very important to the community because it 
involves the application of new ways of thinking and living that do not 
involve addiction, crime, and incarceration. It will give people in the 
community other ways, other options and means of meeting their needs. It
 also gives those on the streets ways to work on themselves in an 
atmosphere that they are more comfortable with (such as a community 
house, warming center, or meeting with them on the streets) that is 
outside of a church or community center where they might further feel 
the stigma of their situation around healthier people a deterrant to the
 desire to make changes.","The time frame for my project is about 6 months to a year. The ideas I 
intend to put into action involve people in the community having time to
 get involved and begin making real change in themselves and in the 
community. I plan to help chart the progress of individuals involved so 
that their progress is easy to see. If the project proves successful 
(which I am very certain it will!), then my plan is to implement it in 
various communities throughout Detroit. I believe that Detroit is the 
focal point of the country and is ripe for the exact strategies that I 
will be implementing. People are ready for something different, they 
just haven't had that something different come along. Yet!","Most of the funding will be used to purchase educational materials 
(specifically life skills information) that can be used by and given to

YouthWorks-Detroit's StreetTeam Leadership program will create, paint, and install a mural designed and guided by artists from Detroit's Live Coal Gallery above the beds of the Woodbridge Community Garden. The mural design calls for a 16' x 7' mural created in part using reclaimed wood, with lettering stating ""We Are Detroit."" The lower portion of the mural will include hooks for holding removable planters for flowers, while the central portion of the mural will include portraits of Detroit youth and residents.","This project will place a beautiful mural in a prominent position (seen by over 5,000 vehicles daily according to the Wayne State University Capstone Project), adding vibrancy and color to the Woodbridge neighborhood. The mural will face the Woodbridge Pub and will also be visible from the Wayne State University grounds, insuring that many people from other areas of Detroit and from the surrounding suburbs and communities will also regularly see the mural. The mural will be another bright spot in the rebound and restoration of Woodbridge and midtown Detroit. 

Also, the StreetTeam Leadership Program hires Detroit high school students, providing them with summer employment and equipping them with the skills and character needed to be successful and to be catalysts for change in their communities. The art will be created by a crew consisting of 12 youth, 9 of whom are from the city of Detroit.

To share at an upcoming SOUP, we would document the process beginning with the design concepts. We would also document the actual mural progress photographically through the final installation and present it via a slide show. In addition, since StreetTeam has been involved in other mural projects, we could bring members of our StreetTeam crew (youth and mentors) to the Detroit Soup dinner to talk about the impact mural projects have had upon the community and upon themselves individually.

Started in 2009, the Islandview Farmers Market has been growing and selling its own produce from a small farm stand at the corner of Mack Avenue and E. Grand Boulevard now for four seasons. Detroit’s Eastern Market has also helped to bolster the Market by sending a farm stand of its own each week with produce choices complementing those grown in the Islandview Farmers Market Garden. However, it’s time to expand! We are reaching out to food vendors and producers based in Detroit, as well as our local entrepreneurs and start-ups to come and sell their goods and services with us. We are offering seasoned vendors and business rookies alike an inexpensive way to run a weekly, tented storefront.

Not only are we attracting new vendors and customers, but we are also engaging local community groups to come and spread the word about their great work. Our vision for the Market includes an atmosphere in which good food, empowering knowledge, entrepreneurship and collaborative opportunities gain the highest possible exposure. We want to become an epicenter of positive activity and exchange.

Our concept has caught on! We are currently scheduled to host the Heidelberg Project’s Arts, Community and Environmental Education Program, the Institute for Population Health, Chef Michael Geiger, the Detroit Food Academy, Chiwara Permaculture, and many more. We also have candle makers, honey harvesters, soap aficionados and baking maestros hoping to begin selling at our Market. However, we are limited in supplying these wonderful businesses and organizations with the basic materials and resources they need to create their stalls, demonstrations and activities.

We are looking to Detroit SOUP for some incremental funding, while we increase revenue from vendor stall fees and the Market Garden Farm Stand. As our season only just started on June 26th, we have not been able to capture quite enough to cover the budget we feel will put us on the right track to making the Market successful and sustainable.","This project not only gives our community greater access to fresh, healthy food grown locally, it also gives our community access to some of the amazing businesses and organizations doing work in the City of Detroit. Individuals will have the opportunity to come and learn skills, participate in activities and even become volunteers. Likewise, entrepreneurs can take a shot at selling goods and services, while organizations can share their mission, programming and recruitment at the Market. We believe that a community that eats healthier is also more inclined to try an art project or register to vote. We want the Market to achieve a sense of place - somewhere for people to come and pick up healthy, local food, some homemade pollen boxes, learn a new skill, or just meet up with friends and eat dinner together. In an area of the City where safety is a block-to-block concern, we want to offer residents a secure place to go for shopping, learning and socializing.

We also have a youth programming component, the Young Sprouts Entrepreneurship Program, which teaches 5 carefully selected high school students about food systems, their importance in a strong community and their ability to power successful business initiatives. Working in the Market Garden and running the Market’s Farm Stand, they are given a unique opportunity to see how, from farm to table, food is grown, marketed and sold. They will also be given time with existing vendors and organizations like FoodLab to learn about viable food-related entrepreneurial ventures. In this way, the Islandview Farmers Market hopes to create a sustainable model for food production in our community based on entrepreneurship.","Our time frame is limited to the Islandview Farmers Market’s season, which runs from June 26th – October 16th, 2013. As our Market Manager has established detailed records to track customer counts, weekly revenue from Market/Project FRESH, EBT and credit card sales, vendor statistics, weather conditions, etc., we are confident that Market growth will be continuously evaluated throughout the season. In addition to these facts and figures, the Islandview Farmers Market has partnered with Food System Navigators to track customer satisfaction with data related to access and appreciation. We are happy to share our results with Detroit SOUP at any of their upcoming meetings.","Any funding received will go towards two distinct, yet equally important goals: vendor/community organization recruitment and customer attraction. 

Our vendors and community organizations need tents! We currently have three available, the use of which is included in each vendor’s weekly stall fee, however demand has grown to the point where we are at capacity and turning vendors away. In order to support our local vendors and offer customers the variety that will inevitably drive foot traffic, we need to reverse this trend by providing tent space to as many vendors as we can. We also work to provide tent space to selected non-profit community organizations at no charge.

A second need for funding exists for our marketing strategy. Flyers, maps, newsletters and social media have all been helpful, however we are looking for systematic approaches to pulling in the same customer base to the Market, week after week. This would include a mass text messaging system to send out reminders on the day of the Market (Wednesdays), paid outreach services and 30-40 lawn signs to be ‘adopted’ by passionate community members and proudly displayed around the Islandview Village neighborhood. 

Outside of these two objectives, we have funding needs for our cooking demonstrations, crayons and glue for the art projects, etc. We are happy to provide our current ‘wish list’ which has been ranked in order of priority, based on a purchase’s ability to provide the most impact at the lowest monetary investment.",Detroit SOUP (Jam Handy)7/5/13 15:09,Patterson,patterson111@sbcglobal.net,Northbound Southfield Service Drive SpruceUp,"Remove overgrown weeds (uncut by city/county) from a section of the northbound Southfield Service Drive and replace with hosta/day lillies which would beautify area - pilot project between Acacia, Lyndon & Ray Monnier-Midfield.

The goal of the project is to create an opportunity for youths to show pride and spirit of community and forge relationships that can help improve the quality of life for Bagley's residents. 

Over the course of August and September, Blight No More will provide youths with an opportunity to improve the conditions of their community by beautifying the area. The project aims to have a youth adopt a vacant home or a vacant lot. The youth will be responsible for mowing the grass and picking up trash. Blight No More can help the youth stay productive and give them a sense of pride and ownership in their community. Youths that participate in this project will be able to add the experience to their portfolio for college admission or work experience.","This project matters because research shows that blighted communities contribute to environmental and health problems. Litter and overgrowth contribute to water contamination and sewage drainage problems. Unkempt yards also attract vermin and other unwanted animals. Blighted communities have been shown to increase feelings of hopelessness and depression and have played a role in reduced physical activities. 

Detroit's Bagley residents are suffering from blight. For instance, there are four vacant homes and a large vacant lot on Prairie Street between 7 mile and Margarita. Children from this neighborhood have to walk by these vacant lots. Bagley's residents deserve a cleaner, safer, and healthier community.","The time frame of the project is from August 1st to September 30th, 2013. We could share updates on this project on the SOUP website and upcoming projects. Blight No More will continue to share pictures on Facebook on clean-up projects. In addition, have the kids who helped with the project come in to talk about their experience and what the project has taught them.","Funds from the SOUP will help Blight No More pay for tools needed to help clean up the community. Funds will go to a second lawn mower, weed cutter, gloves, safety goggles, and trash bags to help with the beautification. Additionally, I would like to reimburse the youth $8/cut.

(Math and Manufacturing), the Arts, the World (local and global), and Health Studies to help them develop 21st Century skills for the classroom and the workforce while they play. It is a ""hands-on, minds-on"" interactive experience, both on-site and through community outreach programs that engage children to learn about various subjects and the world around them.

Imaginosity is influenced by other renowned centers such as Chicago, Boston, St. Louis, Pittsburgh and Houston. Houston is mentoring our group as we press forward with this exceptional center. Houston, itself, has a high poverty and illiteracy rate - both reading and financial.

The Center's mission is ""to inspire a lifelong love of learning through the power of play."" Our goal is to create a welcoming, fun, and entertaining environment which helps spark learning through imagination, curiosity, and discovery. Our exhibits, both inside and outside, will be broad-based to include subjects in science, technology, engineering, math, manufacturing, art, music, drama, design, literature, culture, economics, health, fitness, geography, and history","With almost 36% of Metro Detroit students failing to graduate on time or choosing to drop out, and more than 500,000 Michigan children living below the poverty line (Annie E. Casey Foundation), it is extremely important that Imaginosity Discovery Center's mission to create ""a lifelong love of learning"" for children age 12 and younger is realized and quickly! 

Now more than ever, children need a chance at a future where the effects of poverty are minimized, families need a place to enjoy quality time together, and each child deserves an equal opportunity where they can experience the joy of learning and gain the skills that they will need to be successful in life.

The center will help to create a better educated generation through innovative exhibits and programming while helping to also provide influence in the school district, which will in turn, help to break the detrimental cycle of poverty that many children in Detroit and the region find themselves in. The effects of poverty are staggering -- more than 40% of preschoolers are not ready for kindergarten. That delay compounds itself until high school seniors are actually only passing school at a ninth grade level.

The center will have exhibits and galleries that provide full exposure to the Arts as well as Physical Fitness - two areas which are being severely underfunded at the State and Federal levels in our education system. Imaginosity will also help provide financial literacy and civic understanding to its young visitors through innovative activities and programming in its 'KidTroit' exhibit gallery, which will be a fully interactive, sophisticated city based on many of Detroit's beloved companies and services.","Our ""traveling"" experience starts in September 2013. Our goal is to create, build and open the permanent location in mid-2016, at the latest. We are currently seeking a location at this time.

• To change Detroit’s story. Move beyond crime statistics and photos of crumbling buildings to define
ourselves, announce who we are, and what the Detroit
experience is in our own voices.

• To invest in our children’s self esteem. Time, love,
wisdom and money let our youth know they represent
us. By mentoring, attending recitals and donating, we
share their successes and challenges.

• To build a ripple effect. Student-leaders who focus on recycling programs, murals and community projects inspire other youth. They bring friends, building a web of young people who are no longer content to watch hopelessly from the sidelines. Taking action dissolves anger and instills a new sense of hope.

• To bridge cultural gaps in the most segregated city in the country. The Metro Detroit area has established communities that include Arab, Asian, African, Native, Euro and Hispanic Americans. Through education and cooperation, PASSAGE will shape a space that collectively celebrates our identities. We will cross religious, cultural and political divides to speak human to human.

• To connect our youth. The connections made during PASSAGE could lead to scholarship or future job opportunities for these young warrior writers.

• To set the standard of what we expect from our leaders. PASSAGE will focus on lessons in integrity, creativity, compassion and courage.

• To help our students spread their message! Their poems will go viral, allowing young warriors to see themselves through a new lens. We want to see ourselves as heroes/agents of change, instead of victims/criminals. Seeing a true reflection will help us heal.

• To declare: WE WILL PROTECT EACH OTHER. We must guard against those that believe our children are disposable. This is an opportunity to send a reminder: every member of our community is precious, especially our youth. We invest in them. We protect them.","Our workshop begins July 29 and runs through August 9th. On August 9, we will hold a final recital, where we would prominently display SOUP's logo in our recital program.

We are starting a four to six week pilot program in Rosedale Park to prove our concept that grocery and produce home delivery can work in Detroit. According to the 2011-2012 Detroit Food System Report, one in three Detroit households does not have a vehicle and in some neighborhoods it’s as few as one in five. That leaves these Detroiters with limited options for grocery shopping. With no major grocery chains in Detroit currently, these residents have to shop at neighborhood grocery stores or use limited public transportation options to shop outside of Detroit. Unfortunately, a large number of Detroit neighborhood grocery stores have a poor quality of foods, a lacking of variety and selections, and unaffordable prices. Juicy Fruits plans to offer home delivery of quality groceries and fresh produce to Detroiters, and we intend to prove that Juicy Fruits, LLC can work in Detroit with our pilot program. By proving our concept, we feel we can get access to start-up capital and start offering grocery home delivery in Detroit.","This project matters to the Detroit community because Juicy Fruits, LLC is partnering with Metro Foodland and other Detroit neighborhood grocers, with the zip codes surrounding Metro Foodland being the first delivery areas in Detroit. All Detroiters need alternatives and options for grocery shopping in the city. By proving that grocery home delivery can be sustainable and profitable in Detroit, we can get start-up capital and begin delivery service in the city.

The proceeds of the event will go to the special development of health-promotion programming at the Community Health and Social Services (CHASS) Community Education Center. 

As the goal of this race is to promote physical activity in our patient population, we have proposed to offer significantly reduced fees to our patients. Regrettably, we do not have all of the funds necessary to make this important event happen. Funds are needed to supplement the CHASS patients’ entry fee. The remaining funds will be given directly to the CHASS Community Education Center.","CHASS is a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) that provides primary health, dental and wellness care to uninsured and underinsured patients of Detroit. For several unfortunate reasons, our patients tend to disproportionally suffer from many preventable diseases; including obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and high cholesterol. Many of our patients come from Southwest Detroit, and to the detriment of our patients, there are very few educational opportunities and resources to instruct them in the importance and implementation of good nutritional strategies and healthy exercise behaviors. 

However, CHASS is an important community resource and we, as a group of dedicated providers, have been making strides to address health-promotion and disease-prevention education. As such, CHASS has established a community education center to provide free educational/health classes to the people within the community. Current programming includes exercise classes including Salsa and Yoga. and classes in Basic Nutrtion, Cooking Demonstartions and Breast Feeding Education. We continue to strive to improve our patient educational offerings and provide even more opportunities for our patients and our community.

With a full-service kitchen, bar, and plenty of space, the center has great potential to link Detroit food entrepreneurs with the Hubbard Farms community. Additionally, a successful pop-up series would provide a steady source of income for the Fiesta Center and potentially bring more customers to the area in general. 

Local bakery business Sister Pie (see below) would like to team up with the owner, Dolores, and kickstart an incubator pop-up program out of the Mexicantown Fiesta Center kitchen. To begin, Sister Pie will host a series of brunches and dinners as a test run and experiment. Once the kinks have been worked out, the opportunity will be opened to other food businesses, with an emphasis on cooks/bakers within the Southwest community. This projects aims to get funding to allow for the experimentation time plus a pop-up kit for future events. 

More on Sister Pie: Sister Pie is a small bakery business owned and operated by Lisa Ludwinski. Since launching in November 2012, Sister Pie has focused on creating from-scratch pies and cookies with seasonal ingredients and unique interpretations. Past pie flavors include: blueberry rhubarb biscuit, strawberry apricot basil, brandy pecan, and salted maple. Sister Pie hopes to grow into a restaurant serving breakfast, lunch, and baked goods for the people of Southwest Detroit.","Within the city of Detroit, pop-ups have become extremely popular, and it's easy to see why. They exist as a chance for food entrepreneurs to gain attention and experience, in addition to uniting a community over delicious, often innovative, and freshly prepared food. The Fiesta Center's pop-up series could transform the space into a Hubbard Farms hub, welcoming a steady stream of happy customers and happy businesses.","We aim to host the first pop-up at the end of August, and continue at least twice monthly after that. It'd be easy to share at an upcoming SOUP since the dinners are held in the Fiesta Center space - perhaps we could even coordinate a future pop-up to coordinate with a SOUP dinner to show progress.","We will use the SOUP grant funding to prepare both the Fiesta Center and the food entrepreneurs for the pop-up series.

While lupus research is important, funds raised will be used to assist Lupus Warriors with everyday essentials such as medications, personal items, such as soap, and groceries. It is Lupus Detroit's belief that a Lupus Warrior should not have to decide between purchasing their medication and purchasing food. Help is here!","The project matters to the Detroit community for a number of reasons. Michigan’s unemployment rate continues to hover around 8%. Many Michiganders are without the basic necessities such as toothpaste, soap and a warm home. Those suffering from the autoimmune disease lupus are faced with additional challenges; the possibility of not being to afford medication and the cost of doctors’ visits. Faced with minimal insurance coverage, or no coverage at all, lupus patients need emergency financial assistance to attain the quality of life that he or she desires. 
Another reason the Walk is essential is so that it can bring attention to lupus. On average it takes a person four years to be accurately diagnosed. Four years a long time for someone to be in pain as lupus takes a toll on an individual mentally, physically, financially and spiritually. As we come together and learn about the symptoms of the disease, we will be able to save the life of a family member or a friend.","The Walk will occur on Saturday, September 7 at the New Center Park on West Grand Blvd. Registration will begin at 9:30am.

This project serves over 65 families per week with fresh produce and other food. We consistently tutor/mentor approximately ten kids.

My proposal is this. Get people, investors, collectors, museums, whatever...those people who might at all be interested in purchasing art work that is currently in the DIA, get them to buy art by local Detroit artists instead.

How would this work? It would take a lot of effort, communication and cooperation between local artists, the DIA, the city of Detroit, and countless planners. If the DIA were to put its collection up for sale, if we could gather enough artists from the city, and I know there are plenty of us, to display our work all around the grounds of the DIA and adjoining properties and get those people who are interested in buying artwork from the DIA to buy the art on display by the local artists. 

Here's the catch. The buyers would have to pay the price they would pay for the piece of art they intended to buy from the DIA but they would receive the local artist's work and the money would go directly to the city to help the economic recovery.

I developed features like ""Community Service as Deposit"", guaranteeing placement and other programs like ""Adopt a Resident"" to encourage neighbor participation, insuring the resident's success.

My vision is not to only provide homes, it is also to make sure residents are able to keep their homes, living in more comfortable surroundings where they can develop further, personally regardless of past deeds or current circumstances.","A lot of Detroit's crime and blight involve sitting properties, please assist us as we begin this GREAT mission.

U..E.C.W.C.F, Inc. provides outreach services for children of incarcerated parents which includes counseling, mentoring, tutoring and family oriented activities. We have a 5 week group series designed for adolescent children of incarcerated parents (7yrs and older). This series was uniquely designed to include a caregiver component.","Parental incarceration and the disruption of family relationships due to imprisonment can produce negative outcomes for children; including poverty, poor academic performance, aggression, depression, delinquency, substance abuse and physical abuse. Over the past decade crime and rates of incarceration in the city of Detroit has increased and as a result the number or children impacted as increased as well. We have encountered more and more children with parents that are imprison. Many are living with family members that are unable to financially sustain these children. The children often times are bounced back and forth between multiple caregivers. These kids take on some real punches and harsh breaks because of decisions made by their parents. It has sadly become common for us to expect a child to have a father in prison. It is becoming even more common that the mothers are in prison. 

The Detroit community sadly is responsible for the well-being of all its members, including the children of incarcerated parents. These children have the right to feel wanted and to understand that their parents wrong doings and short-comings does not define who they are as human beings.
These children just as all children should be treated with dignity and worth and not ostracized because of crimes (some very heinous) created by their parents. This is the sad reality of what this particular population of children experience. The ""good"" caregivers should not be force with placing a child into the foster care system just to get help. This happens! Unfortunately, the child suffers tremendously, mentally and emotionally and so do we as a community! 

Project P.E.A.C.E believes that embracing these children is an extended effort to prevent/control juvenile crime, improve neighborhoods, and strengthen the bonds among community members resulting in community protection.","We would use this grant over a 12 month time period.

The Acoustic Guitar Project is a music experiment that involves one guitar and many musicians. Here's how it works:

1. A musician is selected by The Acoustic Guitar Project and is provided an acoustic guitar and a handheld recorder.

2. That musician has one week to record an original song using only the equipment provided. No editing is allowed.

3. When the musician is finished the guitar is passed on to the next musician. After a select number of musicians have participated, there's a concert. 

The project has been going on for a year and half.

There are festivals and events that combine ethnic traditions, a local church even has an annual event featuring each day of the week as an opportunity to embrace traditions of people from different ethnicities (African American, Portuguese, Latino, Ukrainian, Croatian, French (Canadian), Italian, Polish, Irish and American). What was once called Mexican town now has a variety of restaurants including Italian, Middle Eastern, American, Polish, Puerto Rican, Indian, French, Irish, Chinese, Mexican, and Spanish that are thriving; the list continues to grow. 

The program we wish to offer to our neighbors will continue in the tradition of sharing culture and will help others learn about the traditions and background of Día De Los Muertos (Day of the Dead).

System for boarding up vacant property,"We have developed a steel cover system for boarding up vacant, abandoned and foreclosed homes. The system has some very unique features including tamper resistant screws, a hinged door that allows access, tear drop mounting holes for ease of installation to name a few. The system also features a brass shrouded lock that is 50% harder then any other lock Master Lock currently manufactures and the brass casing along with our reinforced door prevent the system from being compromised. While there are other more expensive security systems, we feel we have a cost effective alternative to plywood that will soon set the new standard in securing vacant property. In the near future we have plans to modify the system and introduce it to areas prone to natural disasters. Currently our covers either are or will be installed on over 50 homes within Wayne County. We have also partnered with Motor City Blight Busters and secured their future youth center and future headquarters of FarmCity Detroit.","Fighting Blight seems to be in the forefront of everyone's mind. Homes within 150 feet of an abandoned property on average lose about $7,000 of value. 43% of abandoned homes can be entered without any resistance and over 80% of those show signs of criminal activity. Every year 12,000 fires break out in abandoned buildings causing 73 million dollars in damage and 6000 firefighters are injured . Many of our children walk by these very homes to and from school without knowing who or what may be lurking inside. These are just some of the reasons we developed the S.E.T. System and feel it will be the new standard in boarding up and securing vacant properties.",We hope to have the project completed within 4-6 weeks. A media day is planned for Nov 7th 2013. We would be more then happy to have everyone attend or provide video of the event.,Currently we are working with MotorCity Blight Busters to secure a project they are working on.

Necessary to find a minimum area approx. 150’ x 50’, possibly by using Stoepel Number 1 Park area, or any future expansion adjacent to the current Park area for this purpose.
Surveys and contact with current dog park locations to determine best practices and standard necessary to make a success out of this.","(2) Why does the project matter to the Detroit community?
Benefits: A) recognizing a spoken need to provide dog exercise area within or adjacent to the GRDC area for pet owners who are serious and determined about the care, conditioning and upbringing of their pets, B) reducing the number and instances of intrusions some neighbors see when dog owners use the public sidewalks and streets, the private lawns and landscaping, and unlawful use of public park lands for exercise purposes, and C) allowing for a defined strategy for owners who feel that neighborhood planning ignores their pets.","4) What is the time frame for your project, and how could you share about its at up coming SOUP?
Since the entire project would need significant buy in by several layers of the public and private community to provide a successful framework for movement to resolution, there would need to be at least a six month timeframe for Phase 1 buy in to be accomplished.","(3) How will you use SOUP Grant funding towards the realization of your project?

Recognizing the growth area of youth activity centered around skate park activities.

www.facing-al-aqaba.com

Picture a team of volunteers gathering inside the Jam Handy space on a wintry February afternoon. They are about to assemble a unique architectural structure that will live in Detroit for the next two weeks. Within the space 60 life size photographic images, printed on fabric will be mounted; hung from a suspension grid that will allow visitors to walk around and amongst the photographs. These photographs are a representative composite of the 300 remaining residents of the village of Al Aqaba, Palestine in the northern Jordan Valley.

In 1967 2000 people lived in the community, today only scattered families remain. The question, of course, has to be asked why. 

To answer this critical rhetorical question the FACING AL AQABA team has created an installation divided into four sections, each a chapter.
(Please see http://www.woodtv.com/artprize/artprize-entry-up-for-2-awards-comments-on-palestine)

Chapter One, the question is posed. Visitors enter the installation walking along an opened pathway through multiple banners with “factoids” and photographs that create a sense of mystery; as after all, the question of Al Aqaba’s dwindling population is indeed an opened ended question. 

Chapter Two, the villagers are met. Here visitors enter the gallery section of the installation where they are introduced to the men, women and children of the community in life-size images printed on fabric that allow them to float with the rhythm of the breeze. Each image has the villager’s name clearly visible and a brief family history. Hung at eye level from a suspension grid, visitors are encouraged to leisurely walk between and among the images.

The images are augmented with a surround sound audio track containing the cacophony of sound heard in the village; sheep bells, children playing in the schoolyard, the bark of dogs, the call to prayer, the crack of gunfire from the surrounding Israeli military bases and thunder of F-15 fighter jets flying low. 

Chapter Three, the answers are offered. The visitors then enter a darkened section of the environment. Here they will find large two video monitors. On monitor one residents of the village pose the questions heard constantly in the community….why are our homes under demolition order by the Israeli civil authority? Why are we not allowed to drill water wells on land that we have owned before the establishment of the state of Israel? Why are solar panels forbidden….who owns the sun?

On the parallel monitor answers are given from international authors and journalists, from academics and from policy makers both Israeli and Palestinian. In future installations there will be instant electronic polling that will allow the visitors to enter their opinions with an interactive interface that will incorporate a hand held device and instant tabulation of responses. 

Chapter Four, a time for conversation. Upon exiting the video environment visitors can enter a comfortable coffee bar where they can sit down for a coffee or tea and Arabic sweets. Here they will find books, publications and informational resources on the conflict and will have a chance to meet and talk with Palestinians from the region. 

Attached to the coffee bar will be our theater space where daily documentary screenings, theatrical performances, music events, lectures and discussion will be scheduled on an on-going basis to keep the dialogue and discussion open-ended and alive.","With a huge Palestinian population, a diverse ethnic citizenry and a vibrant artist community, Detroit is the perfect location to bring the installation. The topic is immediate and current, yet audiences rarely have an opportunity to meet Palestinians as individuals, rather than as political pawns. For the FACING AL AQABA team the issue is one of human rights, and it may be simplistic, but as long as there is anyone being denied basic civil rights, none of us are really free. This is especially true when actions can be taken to help remedy the situation.","It is our goal to set up FACING AL AQABA in early February, 2014. Our goal, too is to work with a cross section of community organizations to help with publicity and outreach, certainly Detroit Soup will be an integral part of the entire process.","Very specifically all funds granted during Soup will go toward bringing the installation to Detroit, and if scheduling permits, to the Jam Handy space. The photography is ready, the structural components are in place. Needed funds will go toward direct expenses in Detroit including rental of sound and lighting equipment to complete the installation.",,616 818 639810/29/13 16:40,"Universal Empowerment Center for Women, Children and Families Inc.",lhunt@uecwcf.org,Project PEACE,"Parental incarceration and the disruption of family relationships due to imprisonment can produce negative outcomes for children; including poverty, poor academic performance, aggression, depression, delinquency, substance abuse and physical abuse.

My name is Sean. I've recently taken on the challenging task of saving The Artist Village Detroit. My family and I were regular volunteers there from 2006-2008, back when the place was a bustling community art epicenter in Brightmoor, one of the city's most neglected and stressed environments. The Artist Village is all but dormant now, but instead of closing the doors for good, the building owner approached me and asked if we wanted to try and bring it back. I accepted the challenge with honor and now, as director of the AV and curator of the newly installed gallery, I have a tall order to fill. My primary mission, to bring ""art"" back to the Artist Village. My first order of business on the docket was to build an actual art gallery there, which we did. Our first opening was October 28th and it is still running. 
(http://photos.metrotimes.com/index.php/23-beautiful-pieces-of-art-at-artist-village/#1) My second task, and the purpose of my proposal to Detroit Soup, is to relaunch community art programs, such as ""Kids Art Day @ the AV"", a weekly youth art group program that runs quarterly. At the end of the program, all students will be invited to participate in painting an outdoor mural which will be unveiled on the opening day of their own student art exhibit which will be held at the new Artist Village Gallery. We'll invite the entire city to come out and enjoy art through they eyes of Detroit young people. We already have the building, we have the gallery and we even have instructors, and we all know there is no shortage of eligible kids to participate! All we need are supplies!","This project matters to the community on many levels. Art is something that everyone should have the chance to experience at a young age! We all know art is one of the purest forms of self expression but art is also about the recognition of other's self-expressions as well. Once a child connects with art, they become more aware of themselves and their surroundings. This project also provides something positive kids can do communally with others. The resulting environment encourages the natural flow of idea exchange and artistic inspiration and development. Friendship bonds are made, some time lives are changed. It's way more than just art, because it's community art! I've witnessed this phenomena at the AV! My goal is to bring it back to that community, which happens to be the community I grew up in. On the very least level, ""kids art day @ the AV"" matters to the community because it gives kids in Brightmoor and the surrounding communities a positive and edifying option for ""something to do"" other than watching TV, playing video games and social networking, which have their place but don't really build community bonds the way getting together for creative self expression though art does.","Hopefully by Jan 1, 2014, although, we will initiate art programs as soon as we are funded. All progress on this endeavor, as well as many other projects we are launching at the Artist Village Detroit will be shared on our Facebook page. https://www.facebook.com/TheArtistVillage.

If the fees for videography/photography, promotional material, event staff such as video and audio engineers, awards and even the booking of the venue were available sooner, the preparation process would flow smoother. After the completion of this and all of the other events to come, the winners could showcase at the next Detroit SOUP in addition to sharing their experiences at the event. This would also provide the dance community with another opportunity to share their gifts as well as spread more awareness to this great cause!","The funding provided by Detroit SOUP will allow us to continue our endeavors in many ways. One event that SKilled Productions intends to focus on is a multidimensional dance showcase and tournament entitled SAVAGE Dance Tournament.The primary purpose of the tournament is to promote unity along with healthy competition in the dance community. The combination of the two encourage progression among dancers which is vital to bring Michigan back to where it once was.

SAVAGE last took place on October 17th & 18th, 2013 at The Jam Handy Building in Detroit, MI. It was a great event however, with more funding for promotional aides (such as flyers, internet, radio and newspaper aids and other advertisement), as well as money for more notable judges, awards, and a host of other things, the event could be an even larger success and, ultimately, more effective.",,313205387711/23/13 14:55,Ebony Rutherford,tgarage07@gmail.com,Trish's Garage-Image Workshops,We provide image workshops to provide you with information and techniques to ensure your first impression is your best impression.,"This project matters because we want to stop the negative image of Detroiter portrayed in the media.

We provide free workshops that focus on your image and conversational techniques.","We’re looking to have at least 1 workshop every two months starting in 2014, with the first workshop at the end of January.

I also am committed to making people with specialty diets delicious foods as well as traditional food healthier. So that way no one has to feel ostracized when eating out, I offer raw food, vegan, nut-free, wheat free goods and more. I have done pop-ups around the city of Detroit, and was one of th people highlighted by the FoodLab's First Business Bootcamp where I was asked to make a specialty item for the presenter's gift basket. I have also been endorsed by Chef Phil of Colors and Anjelic of People's Kitchen to cater the Detroit Future Youth program through Allied Media's retreat as well as other event's at The Commons. I have also taught a class in Hamtramck thru Welcoming MI, showing people how to make a Southern American dish healthier with my own twist ""Hoppin John Fritterts"".

My project is to expand my triple-bottom line business so that I can move from being in the cottage food industry and private catering to being a producer and caterer in a new way.","am committed to Detroit as I have worked with local artists to boost my branding and marketing, and I am very interested in anchoring a larger business model in the city. I mentioned a triple-bottom line business in and in case you don't know what this means, Native Kitchen depends on local resources, hires within the community, and does things for the community at large.


By going into production I can offer more items to a larger group of people allowing me to expand the business to help more people have access to a larger range of culinary products from Native Kitchen. It will allow for the sale of the most successful products by those who wish to offer and learn more about the products offered by Native Kitchen
 
It will grow the business over time allowing for the purchase of property to build the following using local resourses, companies, etc.
 
 - 2 dedicated kitchens in the back, one being 100% gluten free
 - An eatery in the front serving with various dietary needs.

 - Local businesses with be supplied with specifically tailored goods by Native Kitchen

 - An exciting line of green mobil baked goods and beverage carts. 

(They will be for rent by low income persons. They will be trained how to provide for customer service and how to run their cart business.) 


A portion of the rental cost will be set aside as a fund to help people with school or other training needs to help them make more choices for their own lives. This is a mission I am committed to because I personally have been affected by not-so-great surprises in life, when my father passed from complications or a remission reversing at a unbeleivable rate when i was little. My mother passed away recently and I had to rely on different people and friends in order to take care of some problems associated with that as well as some other things. Thankfully I have been able to rely on skillsets that I have learned in order to support myself. It is this ability to build a skillset that I believe will help others in Detroit.","The full project will take some years to complete. But, the portion of the project I am asking funds for will start in December and progress will be seen through out the year of 2014. 


There will be updates every four months. The updates will be able to be physically seen as well as a report given to Soup and an update on how this has helped Native Kitchen on it's Facebook page and eventual Website. The media page will be updated when every new location is secured from farmers markets to food events and business to business sales. And, the progress of Native Kitchen will be sent out as a report every 4 months in person at SOUP or one of their meetings when possible. will be poster in a section on the media pages every 6 months. As time progresses a point will be made to report to Soup a 2 times a year showing the progress of the company and still twice a year on the media pages.","With the support of those who attend SOUP I will not only be able to afford a year's worth of insurance to make enough money to expand the business into a producer, but also sell in areas that I don't have access to at the moment. The attention alone from SOUP will help gain more clients and a following. This will allow Native Kitchen to get a better business footing, and make connections with the community to lay the foundation for this big next step.

I would also be able to use some of the funds towards a green, environmentally friendly form of transporting my goods.",,313-310-362511/27/13 16:32,Joseph Schaefer,tabletopteaching@outlook.com,Tabletop Teaching,"By focusing on communities facing financial difficulties and academic institutions stricken with educational shortcomings, this organization is dedicated to instilling within our youth the power of critical thinking and the knowledge to succeed. Dealing with the subjects of English, mathematics, statistics, economics, geopolitics, and communication; children will learn how to apply aspects of different board games to real-world scenarios. Session will take place in those schools that we aim to help immediately following normal school hours. Each session will put a spotlight on one subject, and consist of three parts:

1) The students will be taught the rules of the board game of the day.
 
2) Students will be given adequate time to play that day’s game in a friendly and encouraging environment.
 
3) After being given ample time to thoroughly play through the game, the children’s attention will be redirected to the session’s facilitator. The facilitator will point out aspects of the game that can be reapplied to real-world scenarios, and the children will be encouraged to have a group discussion on why those aspects of the game are important.

Session will also take place at community libraries where everyone would be welcome to attend. This would be so students and parents will be able to see how Tabletop Teaching operates and helps children learn. Additionally, teachers will be asked to allow Tabletop Teaching to host demonstrations within their classes during class hours in an attempt to encourage children to participate in the after-school activities.","Many students of low-income families come home from school to empty houses, because many families require both parents (if it is a two-parent household) to work in able to make ends meet. This unfortunate reality denies parents the ability to adequately oversee their children's educational development or afford them the ability to properly instill within their children the importance of a quality education. This parental vacancy leaves children to their own devices and promotes adolescent vagrancy. 

This is where Tabletop Teaching comes in. By being an after-school program, Tabletop Teaching gives these children a place to congregate after class instead of wondering home alone, and it gives them a chance to have fun with their peers instead of encouraging misbehavior. Additionally, by making education fun and engaging, it gives children the ability to see the importance of an education without them feeling like the information they're learning has no practical application.","Tabletop Teaching is hoping to start holding sessions within local schools by early 2014 and plan to continue holding those sessions for the entirety of the school year. There is no planned end date for this organization, because we feel that there will always be students that need assistance and we hope to help those who need it for as long as we can. 

At SOUP, we can explain to those in attendance the methodology of our sessions; the board games we plan to use and how those games are able to facilitate learning; and the way we plan to work with teacher to track students' progress, so we can better assess the practices that work and hone the efficiency of our organization. Additionally, we can explain the way our organization acquires funds, uses those funds, and reaches out and gives back to the community at large.","As you probably already know, running a non-profit organization is not cheap, especially one that relies heavily on individuals willing to dedicate their time to educating large groups of people. Additionally, there is the time necessary for lesson planning. Other fiscal responsibilities that are typical include fees for the legal counsel associated with a non-profit, and accounting fees charged by a CPA. 

However, the biggest and most important expenditure for this venture is the board games themselves. The average price of a board game that is going to be used costs between $50 and $100, and each session will require four copies of the board game being used during that lesson. This put the cost for each lesson in the price range of $200 - $400 for materials alone. Other costs included in each session are the employment of the lesson’s facilitator and the travel expenses of those facilitators.

Plus, funds will be dedicated to providing the students with fresh fruits and vegetables during each session. It is our belief that the mind cannot flourish if the body lacks the sustenance it needs to function. Also, we don’t think it is possible for individuals to focus if they are too busy thinking about where their next meal may be coming from, so to best service the children being educated, healthy food choices will be available to make sure they can pay attention to that day’s lesson instead of paying attention to their grumbling stomachs.",,734-812-010312/2/13 10:55,April L.

A majority of auto enthusiasts go online weekly if not daily for research and entertainment purposes. Due to the high levels of user engagement on these sites, pretty much any information one would want about a car is online; whether it is pictorial DIYs showing how to complete mechanical tasks or hard data such as a vehicle’s wheel hub diameter or sales numbers for a given year. 

A majority of these sites are set up for fostering discussion and posting news stories, not information storage and retrieval. There are thousands of sites available. This is why finding information is a painful and arduous process. It takes a long time visiting several sites to find what you need and sift through conflicting and incorrect information. There currently isn’t a single encyclopedia-like site that houses this information in a way that makes it easy to retrieve. 

DIYautoFTW.com will fill that niche and be the single most trusted depository of automotive knowledge. The site is a library with a page for every vehicle. These pages have extensive data tables and pictorial DIYs organized by topic. The easy to browse structure makes any piece of automotive information available within three clicks. People can read articles and build journals of any car they wish. Hundreds of enthusiasts have seen the potential and have donated thousands of DIY articles. Many auto sites get several million visitors per month, DIYautoFTW.com has the potential to build a vast, global community of loyal users.","Detroit is a hub of automotive and DIY culture.

We hope to work with the local government, community leaders and local business to leverage financing for projects benefiting the community. We aim to inspire grassroots urban renewal through everything from beautifying and cleaning the riverfront to assisting the development of small businesses within the city.","As we see it, the main issues concerning Detroit are two-pronged: the inability of the municipal government to respond effectively to the needs of the city (through a lack of financing, debt obligations, and lack of trust by the people) and the disconnect between the suburbs and the city. Our social venture, Revive Detroit, will hope to address both of these problems through our crowdfunding platform. 

In regards to the first problem, our platform utilizes community funds that are free of pension or other debt liabilities of the government and can therefore be focused on community projects. While the municipal government is bankrupt, most of the residents and citizens of the Metro-Detroit area are not. Additionally, the people no longer trust the municipal government, which is plagued with corruption, or the “emergency government”, which is often seen as an outsider, in solving the city’s woes. Our platform will alleviate these issues by taking the responsibility and management of the community funds out of just the municipal government’s hands and partner with key players, community activists, and local businesses. This is not to be confused with the notion that we are taking responsibility away from the government of Detroit. Our project hopes to work in conjunction with local leaders to complete community projects that the government would otherwise not pursue or not have the finances to pursue. However, oversight of the implementation of the projects will be from our platform instead of just under the municipal government’s eyes to assure the residents of Detroit that the funds are being used solely for rebuilding the city of Detroit.

The second problem, the disconnect between the suburbs and Detroit city proper, is also addressed by our venture. Currently, residents of the Metro-Detroit area feel powerless in the city’s bankruptcy. Many of the residents in the suburbs do not feel the full effects of the city’s problems and have no idea how to begin to help, let alone in what area. While residents of the suburbs are ready to take action and have the financial means to pursue projects, there is a disconnect separating their endeavors with reality. In addition, while the urban population may have a better understanding of how issues are addressed, a common problem for them is financing. Our crowdfunding platform would hope to bridge these two divisions. It will provide a centralized source for community projects that residents could propose, list, and eventually choose and finance on the site. In addition, our platform will raise community awareness about the most critical developments in the city of Detroit. The educational awareness that our platform will bring and the means by which it will provide many of the residents to participate in rebuilding the city will hopefully be enough to connect more of the residents as they will have a continued investment in the city.","We started Revive Detroit at the very beginning of this school year, and hope to have a working online platform this spring, before launching in the summer. We absolutely would be able to return and present progress at an upcoming SOUP.","We're at a crossroads with how professional we can make the design of our online platform, and this is something we really want to address and invest in before we approach local leaders and potential donors.

Ibn Pori, born September 17, 1941 in Detroit, is one of America’s greatest revolutionary artist-activists. He was at the forefront of the Black Cultural Arts and Black Labor Movement in the 1960s. He worked for the U.S. Post Office and was a member and plant leader of the League of Revolutionary Black Workers. Ibn was a founding member, former President, and Membership Chair of the Michigan chapter of the National Conference of Artists (NCA). He was Artist-in-Residence for the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History and voted MetroTimes Artist of the Year. He was a publisher of Black Graphics International, and a founding member of PitchBlack Poetry (now PitchBlack Arts Institute). Ibn's world-class art installations are inspired by Ogun, the Yoruba deity who presides over iron, war, hunting, and politics. The Ogun inspiration undergirds many of Ibn's works, especially the exhibits in which the automobile functions as an art object, transformed by the power of music, poetry and revolutionary commentary.

Ibn’s art is unique and immediately recognizable. He uses a collage style filled African symbols, the bold movement of colors, Black revolutionaries, jazz musicians, singers, Detroit historical locations, and motifs of family, especially his beloved mother, Zenolia. Ibn was also an international videographer. He videoed the Pan African Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou (FESPACO) and videoed President Thomas Sankara of Burkina Faso and Assata Shakur, exiled in Cuba. As M. Saffell Gardner, his longtime art collaborator stated, “Ibn is much more than these titles. He cared for many people and families, providing them food and resources and finally, he is deeply spiritual.” On April 12, 2008, Ibn suffered a massive stroke while delivering a eulogy for Donald Walden, a Detroit jazz saxophone master. Fortunately, he is now recovering steadily. In fact, world class artist Allie McGhee is amazed that Ibn is now creating colorful and dynamic paintings with his left hand.

Its theme is to tell the Detroit story from the ""ground up,"" by honoring the leaders and everyday heroes from the city's past and present.
 
Using the window spaces on the boarded-up building at 5729 W Grand River, at the junction of Grand River and I-94, prominent and heroic Detroit figures will be featured in large-scale portrait paintings. The window panels will represent a variety of ethnicities and occupations: Native Americans significant in Detroit prior to European arrival, missionaries and important civil rights leaders, labor organizers and current cultural, social and political activists.
 
The painting style will be uniform. In order to be seen from a distance, bold outlines will shape their faces with vivid colors used in their portraits. (Mock-up drawings attached in separate email.)
 
The historic two-story building project site at 5729 W. Grand River towers over the street near the I-94 freeway intersection. It has 16 identical 10 foot by 7 foot windows, all facing one direction. This is the perfect setting for an outdoor portrait gallery and is near the burgeoning Grand River Creative Corridor. The portraits will be hand-painted by artist, Nicole Macdonald, on inch-thick recycled wood, coated with sealer, and drilled into the window molding. They should withstand the elements for several years.
 
Part of the series allure is that a number of portraits will be instantly recognizable. Others may be less well-known and thus provide discovery and revelation for the viewers. For instance, Detroit politicians who have made high-profile contributions: Erma Henderson, Maryann Mahaffey, and Kenny Cockrel Sr. Additionally, individuals working against current injustices will be included: Grace Lee Boggs, Malik Yakini, and the Reverend James L. Meyer, to name a few. 
 
As the project continues, community groups will be consulted to generate ideas and nominees for the portrait gallery. Schools and youth groups will paint panels, and help identify blighted homes to serve as additional public galleries for the portrait series. The intention is to generate interest and stimulate discussion about the city of Detroit and its history. This project will serve to invigorate the community by providing colorful art, local and relevant history, and helping to eliminate neighborhood blight.","Art brings life to a neighborhood. The Detroit Portrait Series will bring vitality and energy to a depressed strip on Grand River & I-94, and will board-up a 3-story building that is currently open and a neighborhood eye-sore. The area will be revitalized with portraits, art and history on view for both passing pedestrians and motorists.
 
A sense of pride will be generated by the outdoor portrait series, as audiences witness their local heroes coming to life on the three-story and nearly 100 ft wall. The portraits should serve as a stimulant for exploration as well -- as viewers will be encouraged to investigate 'the heroes' with whom they are unfamiliar. An awareness of Detroit’s rich cultural heritage will be seen through the variety of ethnicities, backgrounds and struggles of the portrayed individuals.","The painting project will take six to nine months to complete and has already begun. Eight panels, 10 foot x 7 foot, can be completed and installed by May 2014. The installation will be videotaped and may be viewed at a subsequent SOUP. Before panel installation there will be a public show of the portraits at a large venue -- Tangent Gallery, or 333 Midland Factory. Notable members of the Detroit community relevant to those portrayed on the panels, will be invited to speak at the event. SOUP will be welcome to attend this panel-gallery display.
 
On-going progress reports to SOUP would be welcome. The intention is for the portraits to be displayed on this busy intersection for a longtime to come!","SOUP funding will go towards supplies -- salvaged wood, paint, brushes and sealer. The budget is below, though we are working on donations to help cover costs.

Budget for 5729 W Grand River Costs, Detroit Portrait Series:
Wood panels, either salvaged or purchased, $50 per sheet x 16 = $800

A book club for girls who tell their own story

“I have a passion for teaching kids to be readers, to become comfortable with a book, not daunted. Books shouldn’t be daunting, they should be funny, exciting and wonderful; and learning to be a reader gives a terrific advantage.” ~Roald Dahl

PROBLEM:
According to the National Institute for Literacy, nearly half of Detroit’s population is functionally illiterate. Meaning their lack of skills in reading comprehension deter them from economic stability and accomplishing career goals. 

Additionally, due to technological advances and video games the number of children who read regularly continues to decline. A study done between the ages 8-16, only 28% of children read leisurely.

Therefore, Detroit children need an outlet to cultivate their reading skills in an enticing manner. 

SOLUTION:

To combat illiteracy in Detroit and the lack of reading amongst children, Progressionista seeks to expose girls in the city to reading leisurely. The program will provide fun, exciting literature chosen by the girls themselves through a monthly “book club” style meeting. The program is for girl’s ages 8-12, whose reading patterns at this age will be carried with them for their entire life. 

Progressionista also seeks to show these girls the impact of reading. Every meeting a speaker will come whose career field mirrors one of the characters in the book we will read. This will not only excite the girls to read the book but hone their professional development skills.

STRATEGY:
Progressionista’s strategy is to increase literacy through exposing reading in a fun environment for girls ages 8-12.

Tactic 1: Provide relatable books the girls are excited about reading. Allow them to vote from a series of books every meeting so they will feel included in the process and take ownership of their reading.

Tactic 2: Over the course of the program allow each girl to write a story of their own and have it published. This will show them the process behind creating literature and further excite them about reading. 

Tactic 3: Discuss each book the girls have read to analyze the message within the writing. Connect with the girls’ personal lives to enhance their critical thinking skills when reading. 

Tactic 4: Start each book with a presentation from someone in the same career field as one of the characters. This not only sparks their interest to read but enhances their understanding of career preparation through literacy. Each presenter will share a book that inspired them throughout their career. 

Tactic 5: Hold an essay competition analyzing one of the books they have read. The winner will receive a Kindle, Barnes and Noble gift card or another gift that encourages reading. 

GOAL: Progressionista’s goal is to impact Detroit’s illiteracy rate positively and increase the number of children who read leisurely.

Objective 1: Increase participants reading level to above their grade level after completion of the 1 year program. 

Objective 2: Increase the amount each participant reads leisurely by 100%.

Objective 3: Enhance the reading comprehension and critical thinking through writing to above grade level after completion of the program.","Illiteracy is a problem in the Detroit community especially amongst low income African Americans who make up the majority of the community.

The infant mortality rate in the Detroit area is at a record high.

DMPYO turns no youth away; regardless of their ability to pay, gender, class, or race.","According to Data Driven Detroit and the Annie Casey Foundation 50.7% of Detroit youth are living in poverty.

The goal of this series is to provide this community with a consistent family friendly forum showcasing distinguished professional musical and spoken word artists amongst community artistic collaboration, engagement, and performance. The series is designed to positively engage the neighborhood with an emphasis on the youth community, provide Michigan based professional artists with performance opportunities, and promote community collaboration.","The series is designed to artistically engage the Detroit community by providing a professional platform for inspirational artistic expression and collaboration.The event is currently hosted at Cafe Sonshine at 8902 Second Avenue, right in the heart of the North End of Detroit. Each event showcases a well distinguished Featured Artist to serve as an creative catalyst for the event. The rest of the evening is dedicated to audience members who decide share original poems or songs during the open mic. Each event also features a DJ, live musical accompaniment, and signature interactive artistic segments to collaboratively engage the audience and give opportunities for prizes to be won based on artistic expression. A signature aspect to this poetry series is that each event is also a fundraiser for a community based initiative and 50% of the proceeds from each event are donated to a special cause. In the four months that the series has been in operation, nearly $500 total has been donated to benefit The Wright Family of The North End (lost home in fire), The Detroit Coalition Against Police Brutality (War Zones to Peace Zones Neighborhood Initiative), Warming Up The D (Provides Warm Clothes for Homeless Community), and The Shrine of The Black Madonna Cultural Center (In honor of the passing of community leader Bishop Nkenge Abi).","The endeavor with the youth will begin at the end of March and go until the end of the school year. If funded, we can dedicate our event in May to the youth and reach out to schools in April to partner with. Also, The Poetic Celebration will report the numbers of grade school students attending events during the funding period. 

The second endeavor will begin in May, as more outdoor events occur throughout the warmer months, and go until the end of the funding period, or a date selected by the staff of NE SOUP. The Poetic Celebration will share the number of community event bookings as they occur with NE SOUP and share the total number of attendees at Poetic Celebration events based on community event outreach that occurs during the funding period.","NE SOUP funding will be used to launch the series into a new phase of community enrichment by helping with event production costs and supporting two new endeavors. 

The first endeavor is aimed at attracting more local high school youth to attend the program by creating in school partnerships to showcase student poets, writers, musicians, and artists at events throughout the series, and providing deeply discounted admission for high school students to any event held within the series. This project was tested in January with our first Youth Month event which featured students from the HIP HOP CLUB, and Poetry Club at The Henry Ford Academy: School For Creative Studies. In preparation for the event, producer, artist, and host, Ben Will, developed relationships with in school staff to secure the collaboration, coached the students performances in preparation for the program, and provided the students and staff with performance contracts and payments (made to the specified after school organizations under approval from the school and in trust to the faculty supervisor) to help the students grow familiar with professional artistic performance opportunities. The event was a success and created great momentum for future collaboration. We would like to continue this relationship with this school and begin reaching out to other schools in the North End. 

The second endeavor is aimed at creating more awareness about the series within the community. To draw in the neighboring community for the summer months, outreach will be made through a community event engagement campaign. In this campaign, a team of spoken word and musical artists will be commissioned to drop off flyers to homes within the community and perform pieces during block club and community meetings, community gardening outings, neighborhood picnics, and the annual summer rummage sale in the Boston Edison Neighborhood. Outreach will also be made to local churches to get a 1-2 minute segment during the announcements to recite inspirational poetry and invite members to the event series. Additionally, incentives such as discount pricing for Northend Community members who live or work within the 48202 and 48206 zip code will also be given to help engage the local community in attending events throughout the series.",,(313) 399-45293/12/14 15:50,Frannie Shepherd-Bates,frannie@magentagiraffe.org,Magenta Giraffe Theatre Company,"Magenta Giraffe Theatre Company was founded in 2008 and has been floating from Detroit venue to Detroit venue ever since, on a project-by-project basis. Being vagabonds in this way means that we have struggled to implement all of the projects and programs that could help us to truly fulfill our mission: to eliminate apathy, violence, prejudice and barriers to education through theatre productions, projects and programs; and to reestablish and expand Detroit’s theatre community. But now we have an amazing opportunity: to lease a storefront on Grand River from Grandmont Rosedale Development Corporation in the heart of that amazing neighborhood. For the first time, we will put down roots, become neighbors and not just itinerant artists, and go gangbusters to fulfill our mission and have a real impact on our community.","Theatres have been proven time and again to boost economic activity wherever they exist. Patrons who travel to a show often get dinner, drinks, and/or coffee while they're out. A permanent theatre also contributes to a sense of community pride, and our theatre prides itself on telling stories that are important to Detroiters.

Beyond productions, being in a permanent space means that we can greatly expand our programming. We can share space with other theatre companies and local theatre students. We can reserve gallery space for local visual artists. We can host open mic nights, concerts, film screenings, and other events. We can provide space for workshops and educational programming not only for artists and adults, but for youth. And we will do all of that with input from the community.

Magenta Giraffe putting down roots means we can dedicate ourselves even more to providing services and programming that our community wants, needs, and deserves.","Our goal is to sign a lease that begins May 1, and to spend that month meeting with the neighbors and holding a ""housewarming party"" to welcome our patrons to the new space. The month of June will be dedicated to the theatre build out. If necessary, the build out will extend through July, and we will begin programming no later than August. 

We would be thrilled to share the project's progress whenever and however best fits SOUP's needs!","Moving into a permanent space for the first time is an expensive proposition. While we are confident that some of what we need for the space will be donated in-kind or loaned to us, it will necessarily be of a DIY nature. That doesn't scare us; we've been doing theatre in a loft for two years and produced our first play in a space that was under construction!

The real challenge will be to muster up enough funding to pay our cash expenses for the first few months. We aim to sign a lease that begins May 1. Fees that must be paid to the city will total between $1600-2000, plus the security deposit and rent that must be paid to GRDC upon signing, which total $3900. Then there will be at least two months when the space will be under construction, and we will not be able to schedule programming during that time to recoup the cost of rent.

SOUP grant funding will alleviate the financial strain during these first months and enable us to move forward with the support of the community to which we are so dedicated.

Our festival is modeled after HONK! Fest in Somerville Massachusetts and its offshoots, including PRONK! in Providence, Honk! Fest West in Seattle, HONK! TX in Austin, and Honk NYC! These events feature national and international street bands, as well as local youth, community, and performance groups. The main aim of these festivals is to provide free music in public spaces, while cultivating the growing brass band community. Touring bands are also often given the opportunity to play showcases in supporting venues around the cities.

Many of the bands have national reputations, which we hope will draw festival goers from all around, everyone from fans that know the bands, to families that want to have a good time and listen to music with their kids. This diverse mix of people promotes social interaction and links our festival to the foundation’s mission to recognize universal humanity.

There are only 20 beds in the entire state to house these victims.

If you consider that human trafficking generates $32 billion annually, more than the NBA, NFL, NHL, and MLB combined, and that every minute 2 children (both male and female) are sold, the demand for healing and safety for these victims is growing just as fast as the crime itself.

Our goal is to provide: a safe and clean environment, long and short-term housing, counseling, job skills and placement, transportation, medical and dental care, discipleship, school programs for children, child watch, and life skill classes such as cooking, parenting classes, budgeting, health and fitness, computer classes, etc..","We are currently supporting a human trafficking survivor, and will be working with more directly as time goes on by providing grocery gift cards, gas cards, and help with court costs.

Spring is coming up and I would love to start get the lot ready, clean it up, get some good dirt, built an irrigation system and get the seeds in the ground!","I grew up on a little farm in The Netherlands. We always had animals running around and I have great memories from that. That’s why I would love to give the kids in the neighborhood this opportunity to get in touch with animals. I think it’s important for kids to build a relationship with animals. There are two schools in the neighborhood and some families do have young kids around us. I would love to have some chickens, a pig, a pony and a dog. We also had a garden back in the days but the big difference in this story is that in my country people have their gardens behind their houses. In this case we have the opportunity to have a garden in public space, right on the corner next to our house. I don’t see the need to fence it because why would you fence plants? This also will make it a more open, inviting space to come over, sit down and talk. So that will be definitely open up conversations in the neighborhood and hopefully we can lay some bricks to let it be a community again. And of course the benefits of access to healthy fresh food is priceless!","My hands are itching if it comes to this subject so I would like to start as soon as possible. If it all works out good I’d like to go on and do it as long as we have joy out of it. That is very important for me. You got to have joy in what you do otherwise don’t do it!

I can start up a blog on the internet so people are able to follow us.","We just need simple things to get this plan started. We need a truck of dirt, plants and seeds, an irrigation system, big barrels for water storage. We need to get the animals of course. We can use the garage as a barn for now but later on we need to build one.
Since we just bought the house we need our money to get the electricity going and the water system running. The basics first. Then we need to redo a part of the ceiling in the living room.

Detroit Hotspotting is a program designed to address the unique individual that falls into this 5% that live in our own city. An interprofessional team consisting of 2 medical students, 1 pharmacy student, 1 social work student, and a physical therapy student will work collaboratively to address the needs of five healthcare “super-users”. Super-users defined as anyone who has visited the emergency department at least 3 times in the past 6 months. This project will have 3 primary components:

1. Identify High Utilizers: Medical and pharmacy students will identify 5-6 individuals who have visited the hospital three or more times in the past 6-9 months during the students’ clinical rotations. They will meet with the patient in the hospital and discuss if they are willing to meet the Hotspotting team after discharge. If so, they will obtain a release form to obtain their medical records and billing information. 

2. Relationship Building/Follow-up Care: After identifying patients, the assigned team leader (each team member will be lead on at least one patient) will meet them prior to hospital discharge to begin developing a relationship with the patient. The team leader will organize a team in-home visit, identify barriers that prevent patients from attending follow-up appointments, and accompany patients to their appointments. In summary, we will assist patients in navigating the complex healthcare system.

3. Interventions: Necessary actions will be determined by the team based upon individual needs (ex. assisting in paperwork for healthcare applications, funds for transportation to appointments, pill boxes, etc). The first two months will be focused on learning about the patients to grasp the “big picture”. Team members will actively discuss and brainstorm with patients on how to improve health care delivery. The patient will be an integral member of the team and their input will be actively solicited.

Each student will be assigned as the “Primary Leader” on at least one patient. Duties include organizing at least one in-home visit, a minimum of one follow-up phone call after every interaction with the health care system, collecting hospitalization utilization data, gathering patient’s perceptions of the experience, and how insurance or lack thereof played a role in influencing their actions. During the first two months, the team will meet twice a month to discuss patient cases, and at least once a month thereafter. 

Cases will be discussed collectively. Each team member’s will use his or her personal expertise as to what skills they can offer the primary leader to improve the patient’s health. A systems-based approach will be created looking at the social, environmental, medical, and economic factors that led the patient to their latest hospitalization. The team will analyze systematic interventions that can be used to assist each patient and seek patterns of successful and unsuccessful interventions. The primary leader will develop an action plan for their patient, with the team’s assistance using their expertise. A local physician, Dr. Diane Levine, has agreed to provide guidance on the project and no student will be personally delivering any medical care.","In a city where the rate of heart disease is twice as high as the national average (NA), the HIV infection rate is nearly three times larger than NA, and the infant mortality rate is double NA (based on statistics 2010 collected by MI department of community health MDCH) it’s clear our city needs better health services. The current structure of our healthcare system is not designed to prevent illness; it is designed to cure the sick. It’s estimated that 20% of all hospital visits in Detroit are preventable with access to primary care. If we can succeed on a small scale, making 5 patients healthier, this sort of project has the potential to one day have a much larger impact. Instead of a passive system where patients must seek out care, we want healthcare providers to create an active system that seeks out the sickest patients while building community, trust, and continuity of care.

Detroit has the largest single campus medical school in the United States at Wayne State University. There is graduate education at WSU for pharmacy, physical therapy, social work, and nursing. We have a huge resource of young healthcare professionals eager to make change, but we are all educated separately until we’re thrown into the workplace together. We need to understand each other’s strengths during our education process, so when we take our spots as healthcare leaders in the community we can work as a team to provide effective patient care. 

This project not only assists the under-served, but also trains future leaders how to think critically about our healthcare system, work together, discover creative solutions, and become advocates for the community.","Upon agreeing to participate in the project and signing appropriate medical/legal release forms, patients will be asked to participate for 6 months. We will blog about our personal experiences working together in a very unique team. Blogs will be analyzed qualitatively to identify themes related to patients’ identified needs, challenges and barriers to care. Number of readmissions, length of hospital stay, and appropriateness of care in the ED will be some of the factors reviewed. This data will be compared with each patient’s pattern of usage the previous year to gauge the effectiveness of the intervention and the impact on health outcomes. We take participant’s privacy seriously and will abide by HIPAA laws at every step which govern use of protected health information. Ideally we will have a participant willing to share their story working with us in a case presentation format that is fit for sharing at Detroit SOUP! The data collected on number of readmissions, etc. will be shared (part of release forms) regardless of participants willing to share their experience as a narrative. The data collected on our mini-scale project will be used to apply to larger grants in the hopes of expansions longer than the initial 6 month time frame","All funds will be used directly for ""social need"" interventions to improve patient care. We will NOT be providing funds for medical bills or medications. We will provide funds for transportation to primary care visits, canes, pill boxes, calling cards, reading glasses, childcare, etc, anything in the realm that can assist in bettering our patient’s “social determinants of health”. Investing in social needs as a way to decrease health care cost is rarely the first-line approach, but are what we believe are the root causes of the problems. Hotspotters in other cities before us have estimated $800 for 5 initial patients. Each individual will have a personalized plan created by listening to their needs, and will vary greatly based upon their medical co-morbidities and particular environment. Any left-over funds will be used to start up the next group of Detroit Hotspotters or to continue the project beyond the original 6 month time frame.",,734 276 77256/1/14 3:03,Annie Bradford,orlando3angel@gmail.com,Everlasting Glory,"The most powerful form of communication in the modern world is the cinema. You can reach anyone, anywhere, and now in the digital age, anytime. Filmmaking is my calling and passion, and the project I've written and am directing, Everlasting Glory, is a short film of epic proportions that involves the youth of Detroit and other people in the community in huge ways. The film is not a documentary, but it does closely follow the current events going on in Detroit, and allows people to see the city in a new light. It takes an imaginative look at the resurrection of Detroit, with Detroiters both in front of and behind the camera.

Everlasting Glory is about a group of kids, who survived the fall of Detroit, and go on a journey to find the heart of their city, which was stolen by an ancient god, and bring it back in order to revive their community. After holding a series of workshops the last few months, with children from the Detroit Academy of Arts and Sciences and other surrounding schools, their voices have had a huge impact on the film. This project turned into something that has been created about and with the youth of Detroit, and they’ve helped me in creating the characters and writing parts of the script. The goal of this film is to break the stereotype of Detroit's youth as being uneducated, talentless, hopeless, and having no future. They are doing incredible things. And through this film, these kids are having their voices heard in a huge way by helping me create this story, allowing their talents to shine and that hope is alive in Detroit; shifting the focus away from the blight and to the progress being made to recreate this great city.","As a film, this will be shown at screenings in Detroit and other places in Michigan, specifically the Little Theatre in Kalamazoo, and the State Theatre in Traverse City. The goal is to bring awareness to the city of Detroit, so a dialogue can be created about the continued work that is being done and how it needs to continue. It will be entered into every major film festival, and has already been guaranteed a showing at Habbies, Habitat for Humanity's annual awards ceremony. The film will also be employing roughly 200 Detroiters, all of whom will be paid for their time on the project, children included.","Films take a long time to come to fruition, but after working pre-production on this for close to a year, we have plans to begin filming at the end of September, which means after post-production, the film will be out around December. Everyone at the SOUP is invited to follow us on Facebook and Twitter for updates on the film and future screenings.","The budget for Everlasting Glory is large, but I've broken it down and decided to use the money from SOUP to buy the film stock. It's very important to me that this is not filmed digitally, but rather on 16mm film. There is a different quality to film stock, and one that will greatly capture the beauty and grit of this city, as well as the Michigan countryside that we'll be shooting in. The film stock will cost $3,100. Whatever money we get from the SOUP event will go towards that, and if any is left over it will go to the processing of the film stock itself.",,269-370-07916/4/14 12:48,Jeri Lynn,jlasich@vistamaria.org,Foster Children In Need,"The need is urgent.

Project: A web and mobile app that delivers a personalized, live feed of enrichment opportunities (e.g. internships, jobs, summer programs, college fairs, classes) directly to students while enabling counselors, teachers, and advisors to track student activity.

How it Works:
1: Nonprofits, businesses, and educational institutions post opportunities using our web app.
2: The app filters and feeds opportunities to relevant students based on eligibility and students interests.
3: Counselors and teachers monitor student progress through a live student activity feed and follow up with students via direct messaging tools.","Detroit’s youth are one of the city’s greatest untapped resources. Yet like many urban youth across the nation, they are often underexposed to all the opportunities that are out there, whether educational, professional, or developmental. We believe the opportunities exist; youth just aren’t getting connected to them effectively. That is, Detroit has a growing network of youth development organizations, nonprofits, and businesses that offer valuable resources and programs for students. For many youth, participating in a summer program or career exploration class can change the trajectory of their lives, from discovering their dream careers to winning a scholarship that enables them to attend college.

That’s why our project aims to connect local opportunity providers with opportunity seekers in an efficient, technology-enabled manner. Local opportunity providers will increase their community exposure and be able to effectively recruit talented students for their programs. Meanwhile, students will get connected to the resources and opportunities they need to discover their talents, inspire their ambitions, and unlock their potential.","Sep. 1: Launch landing page and file articles of incorporation

C2P-Detroit is a coalition of community partners and representatives from a variety of HIV prevention, LGBTQ, youth-serving and community-based organizations. Our goal is to reduce HIV infection in Detroit youth through structural change (change in policy, practices or the built environment). In addition, the coalition provides a discussion forum for sharing information about Detroit HIV-related issues on a regular basis. The LGBTQ Youth Support Subcommittee of the C2P-Detroit Coalition continuously brainstorms ideas on how to better support LGBTQ youth in our community in order to reduce their risk of STI infection. Through this subcommittee the problem around unsafe bathrooms came to our attention. As a first step in resolving this issue, the C2P-Detroit coalition decided to begin creating safer bathrooms throughout the city of Detroit. Increasing acceptance and self-acceptance of LGBTQ youth and strengthening the agency of these youth became the impetus of this initiative. For this project, C2P-Detroit is working with Equality Michigan to create safer bathroom spaces throughout the greater Metro Detroit Area for trans* people in our communities. We are working to help local businesses in Detroit upgrade their bathroom signage and expand the number of safe spaces for trans* people in the city. We are targeting businesses with single stall, gender-segregated restrooms and will be offering business owners the opportunity to upgrade to gender neutral restroom signs at no charge to them. We want to make this decision easy for business owners to make; we have a number of designs available already, but will also allow business owners the opportunity to custom design gender-neutral signs as an incentive for them to participate. In addition, we are giving businesses the opportunity to further the cause for trans* citizen, by upgrading to gender irrelevant bathroom signs that focus on function, rather than gender. Through this simple project, we hope to show trans* and gender nonconforming people that our community values their presence and cares about their health and safety.","For trans* and gender nonconforming individuals, gender segregated bathrooms can be spaces where they are met with intimidation, harassment, run-ins with security, and/or violence. A 2013 report from the Williams Institute at UCLA showed the following:
70% of trans* people surveyed had experienced harassment when using gender-segregated bathrooms
18% were denied access to gender-segregated bathrooms
9% had been physically assaulted when using gender-segregated bathrooms
This needs to end! Gender neutral bathrooms promote the health and well-being of trans* people in our communities. Other cities across the country, such as Washington DC and Philadelphia, have already taken steps toward gender neutral bathrooms. We believe Detroit should be the next city to take these steps. Showing support for our fellow citizens even furthers Detroit’s revival by strengthening our community and attracting more residents. We know this step is a small one, but an easy and effective one towards creating equality in Michigan.","We are setting out to get gender neutral signs in 10 Detroit businesses by the end of the year, though we will continue our efforts well after that time. Our campaign to create gender safe spaces throughout metro Detroit will continue as we roll out gender neutral signs, and get more businesses on board. We plan on cataloguing all the changed bathroom signs, collecting stories, and pushing to expand our coverage of Detroit. We would love to come back to SOUP and show all the progress we have made and continue to promote awareness and consideration for our fellow citizens regardless of gender.","We are hoping to upgrade the signage at 10 businesses in neighborhoods across Detroit, and we will need a sign or two for each business that participates. We'll reach out to the businesses and install the signs, but first we need to purchase them. The average cost for these signs is $35. While it is a big step in the right direction to move from gender segregated bathrooms to ones that are unisex or gender neutral, the ideal bathroom signage is gender irrelevant! For businesses that are willing, we intend to create customized signs that move beyond gender and simply focus on function. These signs cost a bit more with an average price of $60. 100% of contributions will go toward the purchase of signs.

The program connects Detroit girls ages 8-12 to the benefits of leisure reading through a monthly book club featuring women professionals. Each speaker is reminiscent of a character or plot line in the next book, through her career or background. Her presentation also conveys her favorite books that inspired her throughout her lifetime—further enticing participants to become readers.

Overall, this program seeks to use leisure reading as a catalyst to increase Detroit’s literacy rate while exposing youth to relatable women in various career fields. We currently meet at Detroit Public Library Chaney's Branch every third Saturday of the month during the school year. 

Progressionista Book Club’s key objectives:

• Increase time spent on leisure reading by participants by 100%
• Increase participants’ book borrowing from libraries by 100%
• Increase participants’ reading level by at least one grade after completion of the program.
• Enhance participants' understanding of 8 to 10 career fields and the preparation needed to succeed in it","According to the National Literacy Association, Detroit is nearly 50% illiterate. Additionally, branch libraries, such as the library that Progressionista currently meets at, don't have the funding or resources to create long lasting programming for youth in certain Detroit neighborhoods. 

Through this interactive program featuring relatable and inspiring women, Detroit girls will be exposed to the cultural competency, self-esteem building and academic readiness acquired by reading for leisure. Therefore raising not only the literacy rate but opportunity for Detroit youth.","Progressionista began in September 2014. This year's program will end in May 2015 and start back up in September. The program is monthly during the school year and is highlighted on social media after each new meeting occurs, so progress is conveyed openly to everyone.","Progressionista is free of charge to encourage local children who would benefit most from it to be a part of it. Books is our biggest expense. Additionally, every meeting the girls have activities, snacks and prizes to encourage reading.

For the uninitiated, a little free library is a container about the size of a doll house that is placed outside someone’s house, or in a public space such as a park. It is filled with books that anyone can take, read and keep. Patrons are encouraged to return a book for someone else in the community. Stewards in the neighborhoods take care of the little library, and often evolve into ambassadors for community involvement.

Though there are 20,000 of these little libraries around the globe, we are working to make Detroit the Little Free Library capital, with the most libraries per capita in a major city. We think it's time to rival Detroit's other capital status (the murder capital), especially as the city moves past bankruptcy and positions itself for the future.

Since November, we have installed nearly three dozen Little Free Libraries throughout Detroit in front of individual homes, nonprofit organizations, faith-based institutions, small businesses and a dozen city parks. 

For instance, there are little libraries in front of Detroit Loves You Air B & B in Virginia Park; Write-A-House in Banglatown; Murphy’s Play Lot, across from Mudgie’s Deli in Corktown; SocraTea House, in Midtown; next to the North Rosedale Park Community Center and more.

The little libraries are stocked with new adult books that were donated by someone who cleared out a warehouse abandoned book distributor. Several community organizations – such as Beaumont Hospital in Grosse Pointe and RX for Reading at UDM Mercy - have done children’s book drives for us so we can stock the libraries with books for young readers. 

While the books supplied to us have been iconic, cherished titles, we want to stock the little libraries with children’s books that reflect the community, which is 83 percent African American (and the largest among cities across the nation), 6.8 percent Hispanic and approximately 350,000 Arab Americans (but one of the largest, oldest and diverse communities in the U.S.).

My dream is for these young women to be given equal opportunities to their counter-parts in middle class neighborhoods. We need to think beyond what has already been thought of, go beyond what has already been done, and work with the minimal resources that are available. I would achieve this through a program I'm envisioning: ""I Move, You Move"". 

The ""I Move, You Move"" Mentoring Program stems from my observations of the world around us. Detroit is filled with hate-- mental, physical, emotional. My experiences within various charter schools, as a youth counselor in a juvenile facility, and as a volunteer in a residential program for youth, stirred my concern. Yet, it was when I noticed my rapport with youth that the ""I Move, You Move"" vision became clear, specifically for young women.
 
This program would provide young women with unlimited boundaries where they can discuss and develop healthy relationships, respect themselves and those around them, maintain a positive image, and safeguard what's precious to them-- whether it is family, friends, abstinence, etc. Most importantly, the program is for them to stand up for what they truly want to believe about themselves and about the world around them. I believe that through mentoring, young ladies develop a sense of identity. They become empowered. Their confidence begins to radiate from them. They begin to make wise decisions, and their moments of triumph build memories that last a lifetime.","Detroit is filled with hate-- mental, physical, emotional (particularly among the ""minorities""-- really MAJORITY-- within the city). My goal is to bring young women together across the city, remove barriers/ stero-types and create peace so that we can grow to love one another and continue to love ourselves.","“I Move, You Move” will serve groups of young women, ages 13-19. Peer support groups will be held Monday - Friday during after school hours for twelve weeks. These groups will offer the following:

Safe Space.
Participants will be given a chance to learn, develop and incorporate practical methods through hands on, open discussion sessions, and follow through -- in an emotionally safe and nurturing environment.
Life Skills Training.
Participants will engage in group discussion on at-risk factors: Sex/ Pregnancy, Gang Involvement, Recreational Drugs, Bullying, School Truancy, etc. We will work together to create meaningful (and successful) approaches and solutions to the challenges the girls are facing.
 3. Mentoring
Participants will be encouraged to share issues that impact their lives based on environmental, sociological, and social media factors. 
 4. Community Service
Participants will regularly be asked (and encouraged) to engage within the community. This will be reflected in community service projects, volunteerism, and activism. Hence “I Move, You Move” -- girls working together with others to help move their community and city toward positive change.


I'd be more than happy to share my progress with Detroit SOUP, as well as include Detroit SOUP guests to visit/ participate in focus groups.

The documentary will address pertinent questions surrounding transit regionally by examining successful working transit infrastructures operating in metropolitan areas throughout the nation.

There is an undeniable need to discuss, explore, and improve transit efficiency in metropolitan areas. Fully connecting Detroiters through public transit serves to increase community development and sustainability by bridging people between the areas they reside and the areas of commerce and industry reducing unemployment rates, empowering underserved neighborhoods, and recovering the city from post-bankruptcy conditions.

We're hitting the road—traveling to seven cities with effective transit operations in order to show how everyday people use every day transit services for everyday travel. In plain terms and clear visuals, the documentary will examine the infrastructure of effective transit systems to the audience: highlighting ground-coverage, speed, frequency, and accessibility. Using these fundamentals, we’ll assess how Metro Detroit's current services compare, why they are not meeting needs, and how they can be effectively improved.

When Metro Detroiters see how transit can fit into their daily lifestyles, they'll be in a stronger position to insist upon more robust transit options in the future. Let's raise the standards of how transit can serve those who pay for and benefit from it. Let's raise our expectations for transit in our region.","Filming will occur as production costs are allocated, episode creation occurring in $5,000.00 increments. Beginning with our first episode produced at $5,000.00, eight total episodes will be included in the final production of the documentary. Seven other major metropolitan areas will be examined throughout the course of the documentary, each city’s transit being examined per episode.","As funding comes in, we will continually work towards full production, filming in increments and producing the documentary episodically. In this way, we can initiate the project, illustrate its need and impact while funding is procured. As more episodes are produced, the documentary will serve to show the indubitable potency of a project of this caliber thus encouraging continued project funding. Beginning in the summer of 2015, shooting will commence. As episodes reach post-production, the team will be happy to display our findings and ‘filmings’ to SOUP and share the success in project development. SOUP’s support will be acknowledged between episodes, credited for the production support and featuring SOUP’s logo within the episode.","There is big question asking “why transit”. Through access to knowledge and information regarding the benefits of public transit, the documentary will serve to empower Detroiters to demand improvement in an essential public service which impacts daily lives in the following ways:

- Connecting people between their homes and areas of commerce
o Empowers underserved communities
o Reduces unemployment
- Increase development capacity improving city conditions post-bankruptcy
- Elevate Detroit, bringing the city up to speed in public service standards",,(313) 355-24532/10/15 20:13,Adra Young,Adyou5@aol.com,"""Great Food in the D""","The Cooks and Books Show is a weekly segment airing live on Urban Nation Radio.

That leaves these Detroiters with limited options for grocery shopping. With no major grocery chains in Detroit currently, these residents have to shop at neighborhood grocery stores or use limited public transportation options to shop outside of Detroit. Unfortunately, a large number of Detroit neighborhood grocery stores have a poor quality of foods, a lacking of variety and selections, and unaffordable prices. Juicy Fruits plans to offer home delivery of quality groceries and fresh produce to Detroiters, and we intend to prove that Juicy Fruits, LLC can work in Detroit with our pilot program.

Since the entire project would need significant buy in by several layers of the public and private community to provide a successful framework for movement to resolution, there would need to be at least a six month timeframe for Phase 1 buy in to be accomplished.","(3) How will you use SOUP Grant funding towards the realization of your project?

To engage adolescent girls in order to build character-driven, community-focused, challenge-ready and college-bound individuals prepared to be productive and successful community members.
Vision:
That all girls in urban communities will have limitless opportunities in their personal, professional and academic lives and develop into successful leaders, while contributing in community base initiatives to promote the greater good of society.
Target Market and Geographic Area:
The program is designed to serve girls between the ages of 7-12 years of age in the greater Detroit area.","Currently, there is a need for a program to serve at-risk female youth in the greater Detroit area. Specially, in Brightmoor area. Additionally, while there are several local community centers in the surrounding area none of which offer targeted service specifically to female youth.",I would like to offer this program for a life time just to start off it would be a summer program to be discuss with Peter from the Brightmoor Community Center if the funding become available for materials for the girls. There is also a Sisterhood Guide I created for the girls activities. I would let the girls attend a SOUP and show off what they learned from the program.

The program will provide its participants with an opportunity to obtain knowledge in areas such as career possibilities, academic growth, puberty, problem solving, critical thinking, sisterhood, leadership and many others.

My plan is to apply specific strategies in the local community in order to further unite the community and decrease the levels of crime and violence. The stategies cover multiple community issues such as food (growing your own), shelter (gradual purchase of tax properties and creation of a community house), transportation (community shuttle bus/van), and necessary life skills such as self-esteem, motivation, and purpose. My plan includes the creation of a community house, warming centers, regular educational workshops, and regular distribution of educational/inspirational materials to assist people in finding their life's purpose and passion, and pursuing it. People who find meaning in their lives and who are actively engaged in something they find worthwhile are very unlikely to steal or become violent.","I believe this project is very important to the community because it 
involves the application of new ways of thinking and living that do not 
involve addiction, crime, and incarceration. It will give people in the 
community other ways, other options and means of meeting their needs. It
 also gives those on the streets ways to work on themselves in an 
atmosphere that they are more comfortable with (such as a community 
house, warming center, or meeting with them on the streets) that is 
outside of a church or community center where they might further feel 
the stigma of their situation around healthier people a deterrant to the
 desire to make changes.","The time frame for my project is about 6 months to a year. The ideas I 
intend to put into action involve people in the community having time to
 get involved and begin making real change in themselves and in the 
community. I plan to help chart the progress of individuals involved so 
that their progress is easy to see. If the project proves successful 
(which I am very certain it will!), then my plan is to implement it in 
various communities throughout Detroit. I believe that Detroit is the 
focal point of the country and is ripe for the exact strategies that I 
will be implementing. People are ready for something different, they 
just haven't had that something different come along. Yet!","Most of the funding will be used to purchase educational materials

This initiative will enable a new camp to be established from an organization called Royal Family Kids Camp, which already has 180 camp locations around the United States. 

The project involves using 20 story-telling photo shoots to bring foster children’s stories to the general public. Through video and photography promotions, we are telling the stories of children going through the foster care system, and why this camp and year-round mentoring program makes an impact on these children. This project will enable 30 kids to attend camp in its first year and send them home with hope, determination, and love.

Beyond funding this camp, we hope to inspire others to partake in camps/opportunities local to them, and to become educated on the foster and adoption systems. This project originated from the mind of photographer Rob Woodcox, after a week of counseling at an already existing foster care camp. After experiencing the difference one week of camp could make with his two campers, and having been rescued through adoption himself, Rob had to do something with his talent to bring this opportunity to the greater public eye. After pitching this idea to his creative partners Jakob Skogheim (Filmmaker) and Tabbatha Plomaritas (Producer), the three began developing the campaign with diligence and determination. Soon it was clear that more help would be needed, and Casey Maxwell (Graphic Designer) and Aubrey Warner (Writer) joined the team.","This project is extremely important to the Detroit community. The new location of Royal Family Kids Camp will draw kids from foster systems in Wayne and Washtenaw counties. Often children that come out of the foster care system without support end up homeless or on government aid. We have the opportunity to provide them with the encouragement and support they need, ultimately providing hope for their future.","Our project is currently live on Indiegogo.com, and will run until April 23rd. This is a fully developed and progressing project, that simply needs support at this point. You can see our campaign page here to see some of the art that has been created to tell foster kids' stories, and learn more: http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/stories-worth-telling

Through studying the food distribution industry of Detroit this project has developed a particular focus on mobile food vending. Detroit Food trust is a small scale installation project that distributes to areas that typically do not have an abundance of healthy food. The honor system is used to sustain this project and it is essentially a nonprofit organization. Each user pays what he or she thinks the item is worth and decides whether to trust the system. The flexibility of this project starts to question why Detroit makes it so hard for individuals (mobile food trucks/mobile vendors) to distribute food. Through Codes and Compliance's each vendor of Detroit has to abide by strict government policy, which deliberately says you cannot sell food (a human necessity) in a certain area. For every law there is reason, but some don’t cut to the chase. Detroit Food Trust has become a creative project that pushes the boundaries of food distribution within the city of Detroit.","Detroit Food Trust, if funded, will help serve Detroit and the people who need fresh and healthy food in their neighborhoods. The localization of this project lets people who are in food rich areas supply the people who suffer from food scarcity in others. The idea of this project and how it would support the community of Detroit is to install a series of vendors at various locations according to DDOT bus stops and schedules. The point in doing this is to use the existing infrastructure of the bus system, and the people of Detroit to sustain the function of this project. If Detroit Food Trust can gain the trust of its community, the city itself can potentially help distribute food to areas that have a scarce amount of resources.",The duration of this project will be continued throughout the rest of this upcoming summer.

We’re partnering with Wayne State University, University of Michigan, and University of Detroit - Mercy to properly train emerging architects, engineers, and builders. 

10 Affordable green Homes built. Each of the projects we transform into our ""learning laboratories,"" ultimately becomes an affordable home for a low-income family. And, because we take additional green steps and have support from program participants -- these homes are incredibly affordable and environmentally friendly. The average home supported will save low-income families over $50,000 over the life of their mortgage in reduced utility bills. The 10 projects participating are located in Detroit and across the Metro area.","The Detroit Green Building Hack-a-thon will take place on Saturday June 8th, 2013. The Hack-a-thon event will be a match, igniting both local professionals to have the knowledge to build green AND building a frictionless path to help affordable housing builders make the transition to green!

But the long term goal is to then sustain the flame, and keep the fire roaring. Thus, we’ve hired a local representative to be the on the ground representative and partnered with the U.S. Green Building Council Detroit to maintain these relationships and continue supporting this initiative. Thus, we’re excited by the possibility to return to a SOUP event and provide updates -- sharing stories about the families whose homes we’ve supported and the employment success our trainees have experienced.","Funding from the SOUP will go towards covering LEED project registration costs for the affordable housing projects -- and cover event costs including venue rental fees, local food, drinks, coffee, etc.",Detroit SOUP (May 5 Jam Handy::2900 E.

Established in 2012, our goal is to decrease unemployment for Detroit residents, enabling our students to impact the future revitalization of the city socially and economically. As we begin to train as many Detroit residents in these fields as possible, DTC hopes to rebuild and re-skill the Detroit workforce for long-term sustainability, in preparation for the demands of skilled labor that currently exists and for continued employment on projects that are on the horizon for the city. Students leave our programs with employable skills, licenses, and certifications that allow them to obtain employment immediately upon completion.

Recently, DTC has partnered with the Michigan Urban Farming Initiative to cultivate land in the Detroit area for urban agriculture projects. In conjunction with MUFI, our students will gain important land development, agricultural and farming skills that they can implement within their own communities and on the job site.","Our partnership with the Michigan Urban Farming Initiative directly impacts the revitalization of Detroit through repurposing underdeveloped land and creating sustainable agriculture in the city. 

The City of Detroit benefits through the education of its residents and ensuring that all students going through our program are given the tools to become productive citizens in their families, communities and local economy.",We are looking to implement this program from June 1 through August. We look forward to sharing project developments through before/after visuals and having students discuss how they’ve impacted the community through land cultivation.,The funding from Detroit SOUP will help us purchase materials and equipment for our students to redevelop this land in conjunction with the Michigan Urban Farming Initiative.,Detroit SOUP (May 5 Jam Handy::2900 E.

The project aims to break the stereotype of homelessness in Detroit and to connect each person I talk to with an opportunity. The conversation aspect of the project would include photographing each homeless person I talk to while also collecting their story. I am aiming to bring to light the fact that there are many reasons why each person ended up where they are--that it's NOT always from being ""lazy"" or being a drug addict. I want others to be able to look in to each persons eyes and realize that they have a story to tell. From the stories I have collected so far I have learned that most want to do better but don't know how to get the help that they need nor do they have a support system. The photographs and stories would be put together in a book with the end goal of having a gallery event to release the book. The connecting agent aspect of the project would be to connect each person to a partnering non-profit or resources in order to allow them the help they need.","The project matters because I feel the only way to break stereotypes is to start a conversation and allow people to have knew thoughts. I believe that to build a stronger community we all have to recognize each other as our neighbors and be willing to reach out and assist people who may need help. The project also functions as a way to educate the community but also each person I talk to. Most people that I have talked to don't know where to go to get help or that they even can get help. By teaching even just one person, that person is now empowered to be a changing force and can now teach others around him.",The time frame of the project would be four months to compile the book and release it--however with a never ending time frame in regards to connecting people with opportunities. I would be able to share at an upcoming SOUP the progress I have made by sharing the stories and photos I have collected and how each person was helped.,"I would use the SOUP grant funding towards the printing, publishing and design of the project and also if needed to connect each person with an opportunity.",Detroit SOUP (May 5 Jam Handy::2900 E.

Our organization also incorporates local fine artists and photographers who have contributed their works for the artwork that comes along with our electronic singles. As a direct result of our hard work, bands have been formed, young Detroit musicians have gotten their start and have moved on to be signed major labels.","Our progress is ongoing and we are constantly recording new artists. Our vision for the future includes the eventual purchase of a live performance venue, a new recording studio, as well as a retail store.

As a result, they are less likely to succeed academically, more likely to drop out of school, and even more likely to find trouble with the law. When we as parents, pastors, school officials, and community leaders in Brightmoor heard this statistic we were appalled. We cannot afford to have more of our children undereducated and underprepared for the future. We refuse to fail another generation of our youth. As a result, we have been working for the past six months to create community awareness around this issue and to ultimately, find effective solutions to turn the tide. Our campaign is called “Present! In Brightmoor: Our School Attendance Movement”. 


Our organization, the Brightmoor Pastor Alliance, working with pastors, parents, and lay leaders in Brightmoor have tirelessly researched possible ways we,as a community, can intervene to get our children to school, on time, everyday. 


Based on the work of Dr. Robert Balfanz of Johns Hopkins University, one of the leading scholars on school attendance, we have identified intervention models located in Baltimore, that we sincerely believe would dramatically benefit our community work confronting this issue.The programs, called School Everyday and The Baltimore Student Attendance Campaign, have implemented community driven initiatives that impact student attendance. Logically, given the stark similarity between Detroit and Baltimore, we believe this model could produce similar successful outcomes in Brightmoor. 


However, to truly understand how to implement these initiatives we are going to Baltimore to tour the programs ,to meet with their leadership,and to motivate and inspire our leadership by the success and strength of education organizing in Baltimore. 


We have selected 30 community representatives from each stakeholder group including youth, parents, organizational members, and school officials that will travel to Baltimore to conduct an assessment of School Everyday and The Baltimore Student Attendance Campaign. Our goal will be to go in late May and begin an organizing campaign this fall to address school attendance.","This project matters because the issue of school attendance is one that impacts all of Detroit’s children. Additionally, it is an issue that communities, given the right tools and strategies, can have great impact thus, giving young people a better chance of success. If Brightmoor can create a model for communities organizing to solve the issue of school attendance than we can then be a model and resource to help other Detroit neighborhoods.","We are hoping to visit Baltimore May 29-June 2nd. We would need to get the complete funding before we leave on the 29th. We would be able to bring back video, stories, and pictures to a subsequent soup to update the group on our trip and our organizing.","In order to take 20-30 stakeholders to Baltimore it will cost 7500 dollars. Excellent Schools Detroit is donating 2100. However, we are still short 5400 dollars (250 dollars per person). We are actively fundraising since our small organizations, churches, and members are not able to bear the financial burden of the trip. We are also asking our members to contribute whatever they can toward the trip. The members will pay what they can afford. We believe soup will allow us to not deny any member of our group who cannot afford to pay their own way.",Detroit SOUP (May 5 Jam Handy::2900 E.

The spirit of the event – a spirit of inclusivity, the idea of coming together as a community to accomplish a task or to simply share the space and time - does not vary. All pop-up dining events are free and open to the public","This project matters to our community because, in the heart of Detroit, many do not know where their next meal is going to come from.

We currently visit local hospitals and perform for children during or prior to their chemotherapy and other treatments. After the performances we provide them with Shakespeare-themed gifts that range from Shakespeare finger puppets and flash cards to coloring books and crayons that they can use during their treatments.

In many cases, our program is the first time a lot of the kids -- in addition to their parents and sometimes staff -- have engaged with Willy Shakes and live theater. Tammy Morris, clinical program manager at Oakwood Center for Exceptional Families, explained her experience with our program in the April edition of Metro Parent magazine this way, ""The performance brought our patients and families together, offered them something new – and I was overjoyed to see some of our more severely involved patients paying keen attention throughout the entire performance.""","Several key programs have been cut from Detroit Public Schools and other districts due to finanical deficits. These include culinary projects, but it also includes the arts -- theater, drama, glee club, painting and many others. Shakespeare Against Cancer, although the circumstances are not ideal, gives families an alternative to those missing educational assets by, hopefully, planting a seed that will create healthy, adult theater patrons who will support venues like Fisher Theatre, Fox Theatre, The Detroit Opera House and other arts venues in the city in the future. 

The arts a a key element to creating a thriving, economically-stable city (and state).

Current stats published by Arts Serve Mich: Annual expenditures by the creative community in Michigan are $553,599,668 that goes directly into the local economy according to ArtServe Michgan’s analysis of the 2010 fiscal year. More than $2 billion dollars is spent on the arts for tourism. The creative community also accounts for 22, 335 jobs with salaries amounting up to $193, 987, 699 annually. The creative sector of our local economy also creates vibrant communities, improves quality of life and attracts tourism.","The time frame for the project is ongoing. However, we are hoping to receive funding for summer activities. We could share updates on the SOUP website, Facebook page, Twitter and the dinners. We'd love to have a staff member from one of our participating hospitals come and talk about the program at SOUP.","Funds from SOUP will help Shakespeare Against Cancer pay for future shows in the area and gifts for the kids. Typically, I pay the actors a stipend for their gas costs which include rehearsals. I also buy costumes or material for costumes. The gifts can range from $5 a piece and upward (unless donated which is also sometimes the case). Each show probably costs us $400. Therefore, SOUP could possibly fund several shows for us throughout the summer. We also want to paricipate in Oakwood Hospital's Family Fun Day this summer.

The result is that Detroit musicians and their wide cultural memory continue to be lost year after year. The lack of a public historical resource dedicated to Detroit music makes it difficult to advocate for needed cultural preservation of stories, artifacts, and landmarks, throughout the city. The loss of these voices limits Detroiters from telling their own stories and, invariably, telling new stories that might shape their city’s future.

Artists conduct ongoing maintenance of edible art installation with support of youth enrolled in our 2nd Saturday public art workshops as well as volunteers and partners.","The purpose is quality of life improvement, community engagement, fine and performance art enrichment, and access to green space and fresh food in our neighborhood. 

Our project will benefit the 2,495 residents of McDougall-Hunt, 64% of whom are living below the poverty line. The median income in our neighborhood is $22,895 and many of these neighbors do not have access to green space, fresh food, or ability to view art or participate in art. 

Our project brings visual and performance art, functional art (garden installation and bus stop seating), green space, and opportunities for fresh food directly to our neighborhood. 

The project directly benefits Detroit youth living in the neighborhood (approximately 1,000 youth) and the youth we instruct at the Finite Studios arts programs (approximately 20 youth), through enhancement of physical environment and opportunities for arts and environmental justice enrichment. 

The project also directly benefits the students in which artist Maya Stovall works with at her Detroit Future Schools artist residency (approximately 30 youth) through field trip, summer intensive, and workshop opportunities associated with the Installation. 

The project also has the potential to benefit the Detroit Future Youth network, which is a network of several hundred youth across the city.","We would be happy to host an upcoming SOUP at our studio, and provide a tour of the Edible Art Installation the SOUP funds support.

(Math and Manufacturing), the Arts, the World (local and global), and Health Studies to help them develop 21st Century skills for the classroom and the workforce while they play. It is a ""hands-on, minds-on"" interactive experience, both on-site and through community outreach programs that engage children to learn about various subjects and the world around them.

Imaginosity is influenced by other renowned centers such as Chicago, Boston, St. Louis, Pittsburgh and Houston. Houston is mentoring our group as we press forward with this exceptional center. Houston, itself, has a high poverty and illiteracy rate - both reading and financial.

The Center's mission is ""to inspire a lifelong love of learning through the power of play."" Our goal is to create a welcoming, fun, and entertaining environment which helps spark learning through imagination, curiosity, and discovery. Our exhibits, both inside and outside, will be broad-based to include subjects in science, technology, engineering, math, manufacturing, art, music, drama, design, literature, culture, economics, health, fitness, geography, and history","With almost 36% of Metro Detroit students failing to graduate on time or choosing to drop out, and more than 500,000 Michigan children living below the poverty line (Annie E. Casey Foundation), it is extremely important that Imaginosity Discovery Center's mission to create ""a lifelong love of learning"" for children age 12 and younger is realized and quickly! 

Now more than ever, children need a chance at a future where the effects of poverty are minimized, families need a place to enjoy quality time together, and each child deserves an equal opportunity where they can experience the joy of learning and gain the skills that they will need to be successful in life.

The center will help to create a better educated generation through innovative exhibits and programming while helping to also provide influence in the school district, which will in turn, help to break the detrimental cycle of poverty that many children in Detroit and the region find themselves in. The effects of poverty are staggering -- more than 40% of preschoolers are not ready for kindergarten. That delay compounds itself until high school seniors are actually only passing school at a ninth grade level.

The center will have exhibits and galleries that provide full exposure to the Arts as well as Physical Fitness - two areas which are being severely underfunded at the State and Federal levels in our education system. Imaginosity will also help provide financial literacy and civic understanding to its young visitors through innovative activities and programming in its 'KidTroit' exhibit gallery, which will be a fully interactive, sophisticated city based on many of Detroit's beloved companies and services.","Our ""traveling"" experience starts in September 2013. Our goal is to create, build and open the permanent location in mid-2016, at the latest. We are currently seeking a location at this time.

We would engage the community throughout the process of creation and implementation through community forums including upcoming additional SOUPs. Also, early supporters of our project would receive free admission passes to the permanent center once it is open. Thank you for the opportunity to submit this project for your consideration.","The SOUP grant will help us to purchase portable exhibits that we can take with us to family and community events throughout Detroit as we introduce Imaginosity to the area. These exhibits will be science and/or artistic based that children can use and allow their imaginations to inspire the creation and execution of many of the activities. We will also use these exhibits to help us further fundraise for the center to be able to open sooner which in turn, benefits the communities and schools of Detroit and Metro Detroit sooner.",Detroit SOUP (Jam Handy)6/12/13 14:05,Jennifer Matthews,jmatthews@lushyummies.com,Lush Yummies,"Lush Yummies is a lifestyle brand dedicated to providing customers not only a full-flavor healthy dessert option without the guilt of sinful calories, but also monthly athletic summits for women designed to inspire community, teamwork and fitness.

Its greater downtown is beautiful and grand and I was surprised to find out that the city is facing a lot of the same problems Detroit is - high downtown vacancy and disinvestment in the urban core. Why does it look so much better than ours then? It's because even though some buildings were vacant, they were not graffitied and boarded up, like many of ours. I can't do anything about the boarding up, but I can help get rid of graffiti by supplying a reasonably-priced graffiti removal service to Detroit.

I use an environmentally-friendly chemical system that is safe for historic buildings; it unbinds the paint from the surface so that the paint can simply be washed away, instead of blasting it off, which is terrible for old buildings. The product is 100% biodegradable. It is made in America.","Detroit doesn't have many options for graffiti removal. There are some suburb-based services but they mostly rely on abrasive techniques that damage historic buildings. They are also more expensive. I know residents with graffiti-covered buildings that are at a loss about what to do. I can help them and give them the option to remove the graffiti.

I would also commit to clean up community parks for free or at extremely discounted costs. I live in Woodbridge and Scripps Park is covered with graffiti - it makes it a much less welcoming environment. The reason this idea popped in my head is because I want to make Detroit more beautiful and welcoming.","I have already cleaned some properties. I am ready to go! As soon as I get a tank, I can clean Scripps Park by the next SOUP and provide pictures.","I need a water tank and trailer to pull it. Right now, I can only clean properties that have running water - I use a hose connected to their working spigots to power my pressure washer.

Our truck will be inspired by our great city and offer local brands such as Better Made, Great Lakes Chip Co, Faygo, Kars Nuts. We will also offer desserts that are prepared by two young women with baking companies right here in Detroit.. Those desserts will include cookies, sweet breads, and mini pound cakes. What makes us unique as well is that we will be the only GREEN Food Truck in the city. All of our menu items are going to be locally sourced from local bakeries and markets. We will re-use our cooking oil to be used as fuel for our bio-diesel engine.

Vote Detroit is a targeted messaging campaign that uses the existing and increasing energy in the city, while highlighting its serious infrastructural shortfalls and the ease with which increased participation can put in place effective leaders, as an impetus for mobilization.","Since 2005, voter turnout in mayoral election years has ranged from 14% to 37%, and no mayoral candidate has won a general election by more than 20,000 votes. There are 560,000 registered voters and approximately 50,000 unregistered voters ages 18 to 35 in the city of Detroit, which means an increase of even a small fraction of these nonvoters can change the outcome of any local election.

Detroit’s long-term stability requires a functional and dependable infrastructure. Change - real change - will only happen when we start drawing the connection between informed civic participation and quality of life. With the right tools and resources, Vote Detroit will change the way folks in the city think about political participation and it will get effective local decision makers into office.","As of right now, Vote Detroit is focused specifically on the upcoming local election. Thus, the time from is now until November 5, 2013.

Success of awareness campaigns are difficult to quantify, but we will measure success by:

1) the number of newly registered voters from our target audience
2) the number of voters in our target who actually vote
3) our social media presence and increased number of engaged Detroiters
4) tracking our website traffic

As this area was recently negatively deemed by the media as the worst, most dangerous, crime ridden neighborhood in the nation, community outreach is desperately needed. We believe these are bright children, yet capable of exceeding stereo-types given the right tools like a little guidance, and inspiration coupled with technical training. Children learn by example, seeing their peers positively defy the daily pressures and threats of street-life by embracing creative alternatives is a guaranteed win, even if only one Detroit city block at a time.","The ""Summer Job Youth-Apprenticeship"" project running now until mid-August 2013, will convert back to the ""Youth-Apprentice"" After-School program once school is back in session 2013-2014 and will continue each year, closing the gap on children otherwise left unsupervised giving in to peer-pressure and detriment.

In an effort to help revitalize our neighborhood, Mack Avenue Community Church - a local community of faith where nearly every member lives in the local community - sponsored a 3v3 basketball tournament and welded hoops permanently to previously abandoned spaces. MACC Development - a community development corporation in which I serve as Executive Director - helped establish a sports league for more than 100 local youth. 

These efforts have beautified a central space and contributed to healthy, constructive activity for my family and my neighbors. But there's more work to be done. Nearly 30% of homes are visibly vacant and dilapidated, and dozens of vacant lots litter the neighborhood, discouraging residents from remaining, and encouraging petty crime, trespassing, and vandalism.

Introducing the B3, or Building Better Blocks, events. These are locally-organized community clean ups that partner large volunteer teams with local residents. This summer, we've maintained the entire Pingree Park space, cleaned multiple nearby playgrounds, cleared over a dozen vacant lots, and boarded several dangerous, abandoned homes. 

During these events, local residents and greater-Detroit volunteers are partnered with a residential ""Block Captain"" that designs a project and leads her volunteer team in the implementation of that project. The effort is dignifying, creates and obvious and immediate effect, and facilitates meaningful cross-cultural interaction for the benefit of all involved.","B3 events drive to the hear of community development and neighborhood-based solutions. On a theoretical level, these events are unique blending of internal and external resources, combining the willingness of local and non-local volunteers with the experience and leadership of residents to tackle otherwise exhausting tasks. At a practical level, every lot and home maintained, every public space cleaned, discourages criminal activity and creates a safer, beautiful environment for residents. Finally, at a community level, the sweeping success of these events catalyzes otherwise frustrated residents; it rallies communities to engage difficult challenges. The success is not only for the moment, then, but a reservoir of hope to be drawn from for inevitable upcoming challenges. 

We are not turning my community and its residents into ""a project"" - we are challenging stereotypes, beautifying my neighborhood, and empowering local leaders to spearhead change from block to block.","We conduct most B3 events during the summer months, and usually conduct anywhere between six and ten every season. 

I would be glad to share about B3 and its effects. I recognize that SOUP does not prefer media presentations, and would be glad to adjust my presentation as needed.","B3 events do not only require hard work from neighbors of all kinds. They require access to reliable tools, reusable and non-reusable supplies, and funding to compensate - at three to the four times Michigan's minimum wage - the professional efforts of community in engaging the most challenging of tasks.

I am creating a nonprofit organization called Rock the Stroke, starting with a website called rockthstroke.com. This website will be an energetic, educational and supportive resource for young stroke survivors from the metro Detroit area and across the U.S. I am a former newspaper journalist and a current legal writer and blogger from Ferndale. I am taking my writing skills and pouring them into this project to share what I've learned caring for a young stroke survivor, and to reach out to others in the community to continue learning.

My partner, Drew Podgorski, had a severe spinal stroke in December 2010 at the age of 29. He was paralyzed on his right side, and lost the ability to walk, bladder and bowel function and sensation from his chest down.

As his primary caregiver, I dedicated my life to helping Drew get back on his feet and find the help he needed to heal and recover, including seeking legal help to navigate the complicated Medicaid system, practicing Eastern medicine like acupuncture and medical yoga, trying experimental bladder surgeries and getting him into cutting edge therapy programs. It took Drew and I years to find some of his treatments, and we are still in the thick of his recovery. 

Currently, there's virtually nothing on the Internet for young stroke survivors. Rockthestroke.com will share what we're learning on this earth shattering, beautiful journey. I'm also reaching out to the stroke survivor community and having doctors, experts and healers contribute their knowledge. In addition, I'm interviewing stroke survivors and sharing their courageous stories. 

When Drew first had his stroke, I felt like I was the only woman in the world with a loved one's stroke recovery on my shoulders at such a young age. It was lonely and confusing, and I had no fellow caregivers or inspiring young stroke survivors to turn to.

But in this process, I'm helping build a welcoming community where survivors and their caregivers can support and learn from one another - and see each other doing amazing things that they thought were a thing of the past. For instance, where Drew couldn't walk, go to the bathroom, or feed himself before, now he is riding his tricked-out trike, working as a creative video editor and playing guitar in his punk band Size Queen.

Rock the Stroke signifies youth, strength and rocking a positive, active future despite these life changing strokes that are all too common in young people. 

Aside from rockthestroke.com, I also plan to lead a metro Detroit support group for young stroke survivors who come together on the website, and through local hospitals. The third tier of Rock the Stroke would be speaking in metro Detroit schools about stroke risk and recovery, to work toward stroke prevention and education.","Strokes are one of the leading causes of death in the U.S. They can and do occur at any age. Nearly one fourth (198,750) of strokes occur in people under the age of 65 each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In Wayne County, the age-adjusted five year mortality rate for stroke is nearly 50 percent, according to the Michigan Department of Community Health. These statistics show that a quarter of strokes are occurring in young people, and in Wayne County, only half of stroke victims survive. 

Young stroke survivors have better recoveries, and are more likely to get back into the workforce and lead productive lives, compared to stroke survivors who are seniors. But they need each other to thrive and take those first steps. In metro Detroit, there are many young stroke survivors who are blowing their disabilities out of the water and contributing to the community. Their stories need to be told and built upon.

Local rockthstroke.com contributors include stroke survivors Drew Podgorski, a musician and video artist; Tony DeNardo, bass player of the world-renowned Muggs and Jonathan Parks, a motivational speaker for under privileged Detroit youth and beaming new father. These survivors are just the trip of the ice berg. Many metro Detroit healers and doctors are also contributing.

My goal is to reach out to young stroke survivors and their caregivers through this collaborative website. I also aim to build and run support groups for metro Detroit survivors as a platform to lean on each other, have fun and share healing tips. 

The third tier of Rock the Stroke would be speaking in metro Detroit schools about stroke risk and recovery, to work toward stroke prevention and education.","I would like to have rockthestroke.com live within six months. I currently have about 50 articles written, I've interviewed about 15 survivors, and I have several healers working on their pieces. My web developer is in the process of building this website.

I could share details about my project via PowerPoint presentation, and by having the aforementioned stroke survivors share their success stories and contribution to the site. We are rocking the stroke and we want to help others rock it too!

Thank you kindly for your consideration and all of the work you're doing to help Detroiters.","If I were to receive SOUP grant funding, I would use it to pay my web developer to build rockthestroke.com. I would also use it to help pay for the fees for registering rockthestroke.com as a 501c3. If there is any money left over, I would save some for Internet ads to promote the site and marketing vehicles such as PRWeb. I would also start a fund for support group expenses, such as activities, refreshments and meeting places.

A booklet will be created at the end of the year featuring student artwork. Students will also exhibit and sell work at our Annual Student Show.","Detroit is a city rich in culture and imagination. Our history has proven us to be a people who overcome and a people who cultivate life and beauty out things that are dead and ashen. We have birthed musical geniuses, daring artists, and out-of-the-box creative writers. The arts have played a major role in the restoration and revival of major cities throughout the world, so why not Detroit?

Live Coal Gallery exists to be a vibrant museum and gallery that fosters a passion for art, community, and learning by collecting, exhibiting, and selling the works of aspiring, emerging, and established artists. We provide mentoring opportunities for Detroit high school students, conduct workshops for children and families, and collaborate with local businesses, organizations, and schools on community art projects. Our special exhibitions feature the works of artists who have never been in shows to those who are recognized internationally. Our permanent collection is a reflection of Detroit’s versatile community of artists.

Live Coal Gallery’s vision is to house the largest permanent collection of artwork created by Detroit youth (with an emphasis on high school students) and become a model for art mentoring programs. Our connection with the Detroit Public Schools’ Fine Arts Department will provide the means to reach hundreds of youth who will receive instruction and mentoring from Detroit’s emerging and established artists. Our Aspiring Artists Members will have an amazing experience working one on one with professional artists while creating original works of art and learn about presenting work professionally, developing a competitive portfolio, and marketing their work. As we reach out, LCG will become an invaluable resource and creative hub for Detroit youth and the wider community.","The project commences on September 1, 2013 and ends in June 30, 2014. Since we have not actually started the program, we could share about our museum in general and bring photos showing our space as well as our upcoming community mural project which runs from July 22-July 24th. The project involves working with about a dozen high school students on a mural installation located at Trumbull and Merrick in the Historic Woodbridge Neighborhood. This would give guests a chance to witness one of the ways we collaborate with local organizations and involve Detroit youth.","The budget for our artist-in-residence program is $16,320.00. LCG is requesting funds from SOUP to help towards purchasing art materials and supplies for the program. Our art supplies budget is $3,000. Residencies would be in approximately three schools.

YouthWorks-Detroit's StreetTeam Leadership program will create, paint, and install a mural designed and guided by artists from Detroit's Live Coal Gallery above the beds of the Woodbridge Community Garden. The mural design calls for a 16' x 7' mural created in part using reclaimed wood, with lettering stating ""We Are Detroit."" The lower portion of the mural will include hooks for holding removable planters for flowers, while the central portion of the mural will include portraits of Detroit youth and residents.","This project will place a beautiful mural in a prominent position (seen by over 5,000 vehicles daily according to the Wayne State University Capstone Project), adding vibrancy and color to the Woodbridge neighborhood. The mural will face the Woodbridge Pub and will also be visible from the Wayne State University grounds, insuring that many people from other areas of Detroit and from the surrounding suburbs and communities will also regularly see the mural. The mural will be another bright spot in the rebound and restoration of Woodbridge and midtown Detroit. 

Also, the StreetTeam Leadership Program hires Detroit high school students, providing them with summer employment and equipping them with the skills and character needed to be successful and to be catalysts for change in their communities. The art will be created by a crew consisting of 12 youth, 9 of whom are from the city of Detroit. The statement of the mural and its' creation by Detroit youth will add pride to our neighborhood and city.","The StreetTeam mural project is planned for July 22nd-24th (Monday - Wednesday), 2013. 

To share at an upcoming SOUP, we would document the process beginning with the design concepts. We would also document the actual mural progress photographically through the final installation and present it via a slide show. In addition, since StreetTeam has been involved in other mural projects, we could bring members of our StreetTeam crew (youth and mentors) to the Detroit Soup dinner to talk about the impact mural projects have had upon the community and upon themselves individually. We would also invite individuals from Woodbridge Community Garden and Live Coal Gallery to be at the presentation.","We will use the SOUP grant funding to: 

1) purchase paint and any additional materials (including plywood, painting supplies, lettering, hooks and mounting materials) needed, purchase the flowers for the hanging flowers boxes, or the soil for flower transplants.

2) hire one or two professional artists from Live Coal Gallery to guide and mentor our crew through the mural process from design through completion.

Started in 2009, the Islandview Farmers Market has been growing and selling its own produce from a small farm stand at the corner of Mack Avenue and E. Grand Boulevard now for four seasons. Detroit’s Eastern Market has also helped to bolster the Market by sending a farm stand of its own each week with produce choices complementing those grown in the Islandview Farmers Market Garden. However, it’s time to expand! We are reaching out to food vendors and producers based in Detroit, as well as our local entrepreneurs and start-ups to come and sell their goods and services with us. We are offering seasoned vendors and business rookies alike an inexpensive way to run a weekly, tented storefront.

Not only are we attracting new vendors and customers, but we are also engaging local community groups to come and spread the word about their great work. Our vision for the Market includes an atmosphere in which good food, empowering knowledge, entrepreneurship and collaborative opportunities gain the highest possible exposure. We want to become an epicenter of positive activity and exchange.

Our concept has caught on! We are currently scheduled to host the Heidelberg Project’s Arts, Community and Environmental Education Program, the Institute for Population Health, Chef Michael Geiger, the Detroit Food Academy, Chiwara Permaculture, and many more. We also have candle makers, honey harvesters, soap aficionados and baking maestros hoping to begin selling at our Market. However, we are limited in supplying these wonderful businesses and organizations with the basic materials and resources they need to create their stalls, demonstrations and activities.

We are looking to Detroit SOUP for some incremental funding, while we increase revenue from vendor stall fees and the Market Garden Farm Stand. As our season only just started on June 26th, we have not been able to capture quite enough to cover the budget we feel will put us on the right track to making the Market successful and sustainable.","This project not only gives our community greater access to fresh, healthy food grown locally, it also gives our community access to some of the amazing businesses and organizations doing work in the City of Detroit. Individuals will have the opportunity to come and learn skills, participate in activities and even become volunteers. Likewise, entrepreneurs can take a shot at selling goods and services, while organizations can share their mission, programming and recruitment at the Market. We believe that a community that eats healthier is also more inclined to try an art project or register to vote. We want the Market to achieve a sense of place - somewhere for people to come and pick up healthy, local food, some homemade pollen boxes, learn a new skill, or just meet up with friends and eat dinner together. In an area of the City where safety is a block-to-block concern, we want to offer residents a secure place to go for shopping, learning and socializing.

We also have a youth programming component, the Young Sprouts Entrepreneurship Program, which teaches 5 carefully selected high school students about food systems, their importance in a strong community and their ability to power successful business initiatives. Working in the Market Garden and running the Market’s Farm Stand, they are given a unique opportunity to see how, from farm to table, food is grown, marketed and sold. They will also be given time with existing vendors and organizations like FoodLab to learn about viable food-related entrepreneurial ventures. In this way, the Islandview Farmers Market hopes to create a sustainable model for food production in our community based on entrepreneurship.","Our time frame is limited to the Islandview Farmers Market’s season, which runs from June 26th – October 16th, 2013. As our Market Manager has established detailed records to track customer counts, weekly revenue from Market/Project FRESH, EBT and credit card sales, vendor statistics, weather conditions, etc., we are confident that Market growth will be continuously evaluated throughout the season. In addition to these facts and figures, the Islandview Farmers Market has partnered with Food System Navigators to track customer satisfaction with data related to access and appreciation. We are happy to share our results with Detroit SOUP at any of their upcoming meetings.","Any funding received will go towards two distinct, yet equally important goals: vendor/community organization recruitment and customer attraction. 

Our vendors and community organizations need tents! We currently have three available, the use of which is included in each vendor’s weekly stall fee, however demand has grown to the point where we are at capacity and turning vendors away. In order to support our local vendors and offer customers the variety that will inevitably drive foot traffic, we need to reverse this trend by providing tent space to as many vendors as we can. We also work to provide tent space to selected non-profit community organizations at no charge.

A second need for funding exists for our marketing strategy. Flyers, maps, newsletters and social media have all been helpful, however we are looking for systematic approaches to pulling in the same customer base to the Market, week after week. This would include a mass text messaging system to send out reminders on the day of the Market (Wednesdays), paid outreach services and 30-40 lawn signs to be ‘adopted’ by passionate community members and proudly displayed around the Islandview Village neighborhood. 

Outside of these two objectives, we have funding needs for our cooking demonstrations, crayons and glue for the art projects, etc. We are happy to provide our current ‘wish list’ which has been ranked in order of priority, based on a purchase’s ability to provide the most impact at the lowest monetary investment.",Detroit SOUP (Jam Handy)7/6/13 23:03,Tiffany Moné,tifmone06@yahoo.com,PROJECT Love To Change,"Essie Ree's Homes for the Homeless is a not for profit mission based enterprise whose mission is to TAKE OUT homelessness, EMPOWER the human and assist in the RESTORATION of the Inner City and Earth!

The goal of the project is to create an opportunity for youths to show pride and spirit of community and forge relationships that can help improve the quality of life for Bagley's residents. 

Over the course of August and September, Blight No More will provide youths with an opportunity to improve the conditions of their community by beautifying the area. The project aims to have a youth adopt a vacant home or a vacant lot. The youth will be responsible for mowing the grass and picking up trash. Blight No More can help the youth stay productive and give them a sense of pride and ownership in their community. Youths that participate in this project will be able to add the experience to their portfolio for college admission or work experience.","This project matters because research shows that blighted communities contribute to environmental and health problems. Litter and overgrowth contribute to water contamination and sewage drainage problems. Unkempt yards also attract vermin and other unwanted animals. Blighted communities have been shown to increase feelings of hopelessness and depression and have played a role in reduced physical activities. 

Detroit's Bagley residents are suffering from blight. For instance, there are four vacant homes and a large vacant lot on Prairie Street between 7 mile and Margarita. Children from this neighborhood have to walk by these vacant lots. Bagley's residents deserve a cleaner, safer, and healthier community.","The time frame of the project is from August 1st to September 30th, 2013. We could share updates on this project on the SOUP website and upcoming projects. Blight No More will continue to share pictures on Facebook on clean-up projects. In addition, have the kids who helped with the project come in to talk about their experience and what the project has taught them.","Funds from the SOUP will help Blight No More pay for tools needed to help clean up the community. Funds will go to a second lawn mower, weed cutter, gloves, safety goggles, and trash bags to help with the beautification. Additionally, I would like to reimburse the youth $8/cut.

(Math and Manufacturing), the Arts, the World (local and global), and Health Studies to help them develop 21st Century skills for the classroom and the workforce while they play. It is a ""hands-on, minds-on"" interactive experience, both on-site and through community outreach programs that engage children to learn about various subjects and the world around them.

Imaginosity is influenced by other renowned centers such as Chicago, Boston, St. Louis, Pittsburgh and Houston. Houston is mentoring our group as we press forward with this exceptional center. Houston, itself, has a high poverty and illiteracy rate - both reading and financial.

The Center's mission is ""to inspire a lifelong love of learning through the power of play."" Our goal is to create a welcoming, fun, and entertaining environment which helps spark learning through imagination, curiosity, and discovery. Our exhibits, both inside and outside, will be broad-based to include subjects in science, technology, engineering, math, manufacturing, art, music, drama, design, literature, culture, economics, health, fitness, geography, and history","With almost 36% of Metro Detroit students failing to graduate on time or choosing to drop out, and more than 500,000 Michigan children living below the poverty line (Annie E. Casey Foundation), it is extremely important that Imaginosity Discovery Center's mission to create ""a lifelong love of learning"" for children age 12 and younger is realized and quickly! 

Now more than ever, children need a chance at a future where the effects of poverty are minimized, families need a place to enjoy quality time together, and each child deserves an equal opportunity where they can experience the joy of learning and gain the skills that they will need to be successful in life.

The center will help to create a better educated generation through innovative exhibits and programming while helping to also provide influence in the school district, which will in turn, help to break the detrimental cycle of poverty that many children in Detroit and the region find themselves in. The effects of poverty are staggering -- more than 40% of preschoolers are not ready for kindergarten. That delay compounds itself until high school seniors are actually only passing school at a ninth grade level.

The center will have exhibits and galleries that provide full exposure to the Arts as well as Physical Fitness - two areas which are being severely underfunded at the State and Federal levels in our education system. Imaginosity will also help provide financial literacy and civic understanding to its young visitors through innovative activities and programming in its 'KidTroit' exhibit gallery, which will be a fully interactive, sophisticated city based on many of Detroit's beloved companies and services.","Our ""traveling"" experience starts in September 2013.

Also, early supporters of our project would receive free admission passes to the permanent center once it is open.","The SOUP grant will help us to purchase portable exhibits that we can take with us to family and community events throughout Detroit as we introduce Imaginosity to the area. These exhibits will be science and/or artistic based that children can use and allow their imaginations to inspire the creation and execution of many of the activities.

As we come together and learn about the symptoms of the disease, we will be able to save the life of a family member or a friend.","The Walk will occur on Saturday, September 7 at the New Center Park on West Grand Blvd. Registration will begin at 9:30am. Lupus Detroit is an ongoing project. Not only will have the Walk, we will also institute a Wigs for Warriors program. We already have Lupus Warrior gatherings. Therefore, the SOUP grant will be a gift that will keep on giving. Once the Walk is completed, Lupus Detroit will move on to other projects to support Lupus Awareness.

These programs focus on revitalizing communities and empowering the citizens within them. The organization turns vacant lots into community gardens thus propelling the communities toward a more sustainable and engaged lifestyle. After the garden has been erected, the organization offers mentoring, tutoring, ACT and SAT preparation directly out of the garden. This allows us the opportunity to teach youth about healthy living and to provide them with the assistance needed to be successful at school and at home. These programs are completely funded through donations and volunteers.","The youth in Detroit are the city’s most valuable asset. Insofar as that is true, we allow the youth to express the best part of themselves through community development and individual agency. Parents and youth alike look for a safe space to come together; therefore, these gardens are a direct benefit to citizens in Detroit and the city at large. It is our obligation to foster their growth and potential as engaged citizens of this great city. This project has already had a significant impact on the community we serve. This project serves over 65 families per week with fresh produce and other food. We consistently tutor/mentor approximately ten kids. Because of our effort to clean up two dilapidated and deteriorated lots, the rest of the community has begun to do the same to any stricken property. We want to continue to not only empower, but activate the communities sense of pride and hope in their community.","Each goal has it’s own—yet integrally connected—time frame. Goal number one is to maintain our garden until the first frost; therefore, we can provide a video update of the garden and numbers of those people who are continually benefiting from the garden. For the past two months it has been seen as a pillar of hope for the community. For the second goal, we would like to help provide school supplies as early as next Friday, August 9, at our market Friday. We would not only provide fresh produce, but also school supplies for at least fifteen students in the area. By the next SOUP we will be able to provide actual numbers of students helped by providing school supplies. Finally, we are fully launching Mentors of Promise in October 2013. At the November SOUP we would be prepared with early mentor, parent, and mentee testimonials of what the program has provided for the individuals involved.","With SOUP grant funding we have three major goals: 

1. Continue to maintain the garden that we have at 4005 Gladstone. There are tools that we need to continue our endeavors in the community effectively. 
2. Provide our students with books and other school supplies before the school year begins. 
3. Fully launch our Mentoring Program.

During these thirty minute assemblies students are educated about what materials they can recycle both in school and at home. These assemblies also provide students with the information necessary to understand why it is important to make individual behavior changes to practice three R's (reduce, reuse, recycle).

Scruggs,brisbaine@yahoo.com,Buy THIS Art Instead...,"I am unsure if this is where I should go to field this, and I am less sure if I am capable enough to carry this through to fruition, should it ever come to pass. 

My proposal is this. Get people, investors, collectors, museums, whatever...those people who might at all be interested in purchasing art work that is currently in the DIA, get them to buy art by local Detroit artists instead.

How would this work? It would take a lot of effort, communication and cooperation between local artists, the DIA, the city of Detroit, and countless planners. If the DIA were to put its collection up for sale, if we could gather enough artists from the city, and I know there are plenty of us, to display our work all around the grounds of the DIA and adjoining properties and get those people who are interested in buying artwork from the DIA to buy the art on display by the local artists. 

Here's the catch. The buyers would have to pay the price they would pay for the piece of art they intended to buy from the DIA but they would receive the local artist's work and the money would go directly to the city to help the economic recovery. 

The benefit. The DIA's collection remains intact, the city gets some financial help, the local artist gets some recognition, and the purchaser gets not only a piece of Detroit art, but a sense of pride that they helped save this city and one of its biggest landmarks.",It would help save the city and the collection at the DIA.,If and or when the DIA has to sell their collection.,"To get this project started.

Over the past decade crime and rates of incarceration in the city of Detroit has increased and as a result the number or children impacted as increased as well. We have encountered more and more children with parents that are imprison. Many are living with family members that are unable to financially sustain these children. The children often times are bounced back and forth between multiple caregivers. These kids take on some real punches and harsh breaks because of decisions made by their parents. It has sadly become common for us to expect a child to have a father in prison. It is becoming even more common that the mothers are in prison. 

The Detroit community sadly is responsible for the well-being of all its members, including the children of incarcerated parents. These children have the right to feel wanted and to understand that their parents wrong doings and short-comings does not define who they are as human beings.
These children just as all children should be treated with dignity and worth and not ostracized because of crimes (some very heinous) created by their parents. This is the sad reality of what this particular population of children experience. The ""good"" caregivers should not be force with placing a child into the foster care system just to get help. This happens! Unfortunately, the child suffers tremendously, mentally and emotionally and so do we as a community!

The system has some very unique features including tamper resistant screws, a hinged door that allows access, tear drop mounting holes for ease of installation to name a few. The system also features a brass shrouded lock that is 50% harder then any other lock Master Lock currently manufactures and the brass casing along with our reinforced door prevent the system from being compromised. While there are other more expensive security systems, we feel we have a cost effective alternative to plywood that will soon set the new standard in securing vacant property. In the near future we have plans to modify the system and introduce it to areas prone to natural disasters. Currently our covers either are or will be installed on over 50 homes within Wayne County. We have also partnered with Motor City Blight Busters and secured their future youth center and future headquarters of FarmCity Detroit.","Fighting Blight seems to be in the forefront of everyone's mind. Homes within 150 feet of an abandoned property on average lose about $7,000 of value. 43% of abandoned homes can be entered without any resistance and over 80% of those show signs of criminal activity. Every year 12,000 fires break out in abandoned buildings causing 73 million dollars in damage and 6000 firefighters are injured . Many of our children walk by these very homes to and from school without knowing who or what may be lurking inside. These are just some of the reasons we developed the S.E.T.

Recognizing the growth area of youth activity centered around skate park activities. Since this would be a collaborative effort between several generations, there would need to be buy in from one group to foster and guide the activity, and from the other to manage an environment to foster democratic organization and transparent encouragement to participate as equals in a free and open activity.

www.facing-al-aqaba.com

Picture a team of volunteers gathering inside the Jam Handy space on a wintry February afternoon. They are about to assemble a unique architectural structure that will live in Detroit for the next two weeks. Within the space 60 life size photographic images, printed on fabric will be mounted; hung from a suspension grid that will allow visitors to walk around and amongst the photographs. These photographs are a representative composite of the 300 remaining residents of the village of Al Aqaba, Palestine in the northern Jordan Valley.

In 1967 2000 people lived in the community, today only scattered families remain. The question, of course, has to be asked why. 

To answer this critical rhetorical question the FACING AL AQABA team has created an installation divided into four sections, each a chapter.
(Please see http://www.woodtv.com/artprize/artprize-entry-up-for-2-awards-comments-on-palestine)

Chapter One, the question is posed. Visitors enter the installation walking along an opened pathway through multiple banners with “factoids” and photographs that create a sense of mystery; as after all, the question of Al Aqaba’s dwindling population is indeed an opened ended question. 

Chapter Two, the villagers are met. Here visitors enter the gallery section of the installation where they are introduced to the men, women and children of the community in life-size images printed on fabric that allow them to float with the rhythm of the breeze. Each image has the villager’s name clearly visible and a brief family history. Hung at eye level from a suspension grid, visitors are encouraged to leisurely walk between and among the images.

The images are augmented with a surround sound audio track containing the cacophony of sound heard in the village; sheep bells, children playing in the schoolyard, the bark of dogs, the call to prayer, the crack of gunfire from the surrounding Israeli military bases and thunder of F-15 fighter jets flying low. 

Chapter Three, the answers are offered. The visitors then enter a darkened section of the environment. Here they will find large two video monitors. On monitor one residents of the village pose the questions heard constantly in the community….why are our homes under demolition order by the Israeli civil authority? Why are we not allowed to drill water wells on land that we have owned before the establishment of the state of Israel? Why are solar panels forbidden….who owns the sun?

On the parallel monitor answers are given from international authors and journalists, from academics and from policy makers both Israeli and Palestinian. In future installations there will be instant electronic polling that will allow the visitors to enter their opinions with an interactive interface that will incorporate a hand held device and instant tabulation of responses. 

Chapter Four, a time for conversation. Upon exiting the video environment visitors can enter a comfortable coffee bar where they can sit down for a coffee or tea and Arabic sweets. Here they will find books, publications and informational resources on the conflict and will have a chance to meet and talk with Palestinians from the region. 

Attached to the coffee bar will be our theater space where daily documentary screenings, theatrical performances, music events, lectures and discussion will be scheduled on an on-going basis to keep the dialogue and discussion open-ended and alive.","With a huge Palestinian population, a diverse ethnic citizenry and a vibrant artist community, Detroit is the perfect location to bring the installation. The topic is immediate and current, yet audiences rarely have an opportunity to meet Palestinians as individuals, rather than as political pawns. For the FACING AL AQABA team the issue is one of human rights, and it may be simplistic, but as long as there is anyone being denied basic civil rights, none of us are really free. This is especially true when actions can be taken to help remedy the situation.","It is our goal to set up FACING AL AQABA in early February, 2014. Our goal, too is to work with a cross section of community organizations to help with publicity and outreach, certainly Detroit Soup will be an integral part of the entire process.","Very specifically all funds granted during Soup will go toward bringing the installation to Detroit, and if scheduling permits, to the Jam Handy space.

We will spend the first week researching and crafting a poem. Youth will be paired with a mentor who will give them historical background on their topic. Their poem will testify to the problem, but it will offer solutions. The second week, we will work on performance. The idea is to turn politics into performance art, to create a safe space for inter-generational community discussion.

We will study techniques in active listening, conflict resolution, empathy, live debate and forming creative solutions. Our syllabus will examine the protest pieces of slam poets, essayists and orators. We will focus on crafting performance pieces that delve into the roots of injustice in order to offer solutions. On August 9, we will celebrate with a recital.

These young warriors will co-power each other as they research and perform, side by side. We will pair each student with a community mentor who will speak about the history of that problem. We want to further connect students to their communities, building stronger bridges that will promote communication and change.","The whole country is debating what the life of a child of color is worth. These young folks are watching. They are waiting for us to give them the signal that we will support them as they emerge to become seen and heard. Many of our youth and mentors live in the Livernois Corridor and speak about the issues of the Livernois Corridor.

All eyes are on Detroit. We are bankrupt. We are literally in the dark. Some neighborhoods are ""too desolate"" to bother lighting. These young writers plan to confront these issues in order to inspire transformation.

The combination of study and mentorship is designed to create the leadership that Detroit sorely needs. 

PASSAGE is an opportunity to:

• To create a network of businesses who support Detroit’s development. It is a revolutionary act to patronize businesses whose missions align with our own. We will list in our Recital Program and at ObsidianBlues.com the businesses that inspire, support and uplift the people of Detroit. Where we choose to eat dinner or buy books becomes an act of love for ourselves and our community, building opportunities for entrepreneurs, designers, writers, directors, bakers, artisans, etc. who are not recognized by the mainstream.

• To change Detroit’s story. Move beyond crime statistics and photos of crumbling buildings to define
ourselves, announce who we are, and what the Detroit
experience is in our own voices.

• To invest in our children’s self esteem. Time, love,
wisdom and money let our youth know they represent
us. By mentoring, attending recitals and donating, we
share their successes and challenges.

• To build a ripple effect. Student-leaders who focus on recycling programs, murals and community projects inspire other youth. They bring friends, building a web of young people who are no longer content to watch hopelessly from the sidelines. Taking action dissolves anger and instills a new sense of hope.

• To bridge cultural gaps in the most segregated city in the country. The Metro Detroit area has established communities that include Arab, Asian, African, Native, Euro and Hispanic Americans. Through education and cooperation, PASSAGE will shape a space that collectively celebrates our identities. We will cross religious, cultural and political divides to speak human to human.

• To connect our youth. The connections made during PASSAGE could lead to scholarship or future job opportunities for these young warrior writers.

• To set the standard of what we expect from our leaders. PASSAGE will focus on lessons in integrity, creativity, compassion and courage.

• To help our students spread their message! Their poems will go viral, allowing young warriors to see themselves through a new lens. We want to see ourselves as heroes/agents of change, instead of victims/criminals. Seeing a true reflection will help us heal.

• To declare: WE WILL PROTECT EACH OTHER. We must guard against those that believe our children are disposable.

We protect them.","Our workshop begins July 29 and runs through August 9th. On August 9, we will hold a final recital, where we would prominently display SOUP's logo in our recital program.

The emerging writers and artists published in this creative arts anthology are participants in Racquet Up Detroit (RUD). RUD is an out-of-school youth development program that combines the sport of squash, in combination with literacy instruction, academic support, community service, and mentoring to make a difference in the lives of Detroit youth. RUD launched in January 2011 with the help of the National Urban Squash and Education Association (NUSEA), and is a non-profit organization with 4 staff and over 50 active volunteers.
 As part of its literacy instruction, Racquet Up Detroit seeks to offer authentic literacy experiences for its middle-school participants. RUD holds an annual Open Mic Night where students perform and showcase their talents. Students have participated in workshops taught by members of Citywide Poets, an exclusive group of Detroit youth poets, and learned writing skills from a creative writing instructor at the University of Michigan. RUD’s believes students have a voice and that voice deserves to be heard.
 This is a student-driven book, from the title that was collaborative chosen, to the pieces individually selected and edited. My Life, My Words is the second annual anthology, and RUD plans to increase publication to 300 copies. With more excitement and student work, this year’s anthology will increase from 52 pages to over 60. The glossy, two-color cover will again hold artwork, poems, essays, comics, and stories from 40 program participants. This anthology is then shared with members of RUD’s wide community. From teachers at partner schools to student friends and families, this book will leave an impact.","This project allows the voices and opinions of Detroit youth to be expressed in a professional and exciting format that will be shared with a variety of audiences. This book promotes a positive view of Detroit youth by highlighting their creative talents. Detroit is home to countless talented writers and artists, and RUD seeks to keep that tradition alive. Fostering interest in the creative arts at a young age is critical to promoting awareness of these career options.
 This book is an achievement that students can reference for high school and college applications. In addition, seeing their work published will spark talented artists and writers to continue pursuing their craft by entering writing contests, performing at local literary events, and seeking opportunities for arts education. Being included in a professionally designed and published book allows students to feel like accomplished authors and emerging artists.
 In addition, My Life, My Words is a collection of work firmly grounded in Racquet Up Detroit. In poems and art, students reference their teammates, they recount a special squash trip, and plan ahead for their bright futures. This volume is a tightly-crafted, coherent look into the lives of 40 Detroit youth. RUD operates at the Northwest Activities Center, and has a footprint of friends, families, volunteers, and school partners in the Northwest Detroit community.","All material, including essays, poems, artwork, and comics, was collated and sent to our graphic designer. The graphic designer is currently laying out the book, and expects completion in mid-June. 
 Last year, RUD sent the completed book file to the printer on May 17, and received the books on June 5. This year, the schedule was pushed back. An initial estimate from the graphic designer says RUD will receive the completed books around Thursday, July 4.
 This is a realistic target, and one that works well for both Racquet Up Detroit and Detroit SOUP. Monday, July 15 is the start of Racquet Up Detroit’s Summer Slam camp. This camp brings together all students, volunteers, staff, and families, and is an exciting time to launch the book. 
 In addition, with a short time-frame, RUD has the ability to present at a Detroit SOUP event in July or August. RUD hopes that students will be able to perform selections from My Life, My Words at an upcoming Detroit SOUP event. This gives our students valuable experience performing in front of a crowd, and provides Detroit SOUP with a hands-on view of Detroit young artists. RUD will also provide Detroit SOUP with copies of the book, and it will be a lasting artifact that highlights the importance of Detroit SOUP’s work to foster creative arts in Detroit.","SOUP grant funding will be used to pay for the publication of the book. RUD publishes with Color House Graphics, a Grand Rapids-based book manufacturing company. Last year, RUD published 210 books, and had them shipped to Detroit, for a total cost of $412.88. This year, RUD requests $700.00 to cover book publication. This cost increase represents publishing more copies, and the increased length of the book. 
 A friend of Racquet Up Detroit generously designs the book pro-bono. She is an accomplished graphic designer, and works with InsideOut Literary Arts Project to design their collections of student work. 
 With any excess funds, RUD will hold a Book Release Party, allowing students to share the enjoyment and excitement of publishing with friends and family.",Youth SOUP (Glearners Community Food Bank),5/28/13 18:47,Chris Norris,chris.norris93@yahoo.com,I'm going to College,The project benefits Detroit Brightmoor middle school youth by placing them with peer mentors who have made it through high school and have been or are successful in their college careers.

We will invite the public to attend and experience the cultural event. We will be sure to make efforts to include area seniors and youth.,"Southwest Detroit is known as the melting pot of Detroit. Living within its borders are families from a variety of cultural and social economic backgrounds. Because of this, southwest Detroiters are recognized for their willingness to experience and embrace the variety of traditions that their fellow neighbors practice. The area high school includes “International” in its name. There are festivals and events that combine ethnic traditions, a local church even has an annual event featuring each day of the week as an opportunity to embrace traditions of people from different ethnicities (African American, Portuguese, Latino, Ukrainian, Croatian, French (Canadian), Italian, Polish, Irish and American). What was once called Mexican town now has a variety of restaurants including Italian, Middle Eastern, American, Polish, Puerto Rican, Indian, French, Irish, Chinese, Mexican, and Spanish that are thriving; the list continues to grow. 

The program we wish to offer to our neighbors will continue in the tradition of sharing culture and will help others learn about the traditions and background of Día De Los Muertos (Day of the Dead). By giving our youth the opportunity to learn and present we are also helping to pass on traditions to Detroit youth with a Hispanic ancestry.","We plan to hold the program on November 3 for Day of the Dead. The youth will continue to learn more dances and will present them at various events continuing year round. The types of events include festivals, art programs, local shop your block events, 555 Gallery events and programs held at the Mercado. If invited, the children and the main group could perform and/or give a presentation at a Soup event. The costumes are an investment that will be available for years to come as the children grow in dance and are able to move to the main group, new children will use the costumes as they learn about the Mexican culture through dance.","We have worked with volunteers who will donate small refreshments, help to set up the event and have partnered to be able to use a local hall for free. Our youth will have practiced for four months in preparation of the program. The children (ages 4 – 12yrs) are learning how to dance, in celebration of Día De Los Muertos (Day of the Dead); but because the youth group came together this summer, there are no costumes to present what they have worked so hard on. We are in the mist of a fundraiser that will help with the cost of boots/shoes that are necessary to perform (average cost of $70.00 a pair) any funding over the cost of the boots will go towards the costumes. We do not expect that there will be enough raised to cover both the shoes and the costumes. We have located a local mom who is willing to help sew the historically accurate costumes; she is waiting for us to find a way to fund them.

The students learn outdoor cooking skills (including campfire skills) and how to work together to survive as a team. They learn to manage life in a setting without familiar amenities and without their cell phones!   Hikes, low ropes type challenge activities, Bible study and spiritual growth conversations, swimming and field games are planned by camping staff.  The 3 to 7 day camps will be led by seasoned camp leaders from Acts 29 staff.   In the past we have camped at the Mohican State Park in Loudonville, OH, Muskegon State Park on Lake Michigan, and on Skinner Lake in Lapeer, MI.   ","Expected outcomes for the students include:  
1.        increased confidence in meeting the personal challenges of surviving in an outdoor living setting
2.        mastery of new skills for survival living
3.        an opportunity to travel and exposure to the world beyond Hamtramck 
4.        experience in team work and  character building 
5.        increased knowledge of the Bible and how to apply it to everyday life

Problem Statement: Stray and unneutered or unspayed cats are a persistent problem in Hamtramck. Humane box traps are currently available to rent from local shelters, however participation is sparse. An organized effort to build a coalition of residents, policy makers, and community organizations is needed to recruit volunteers, educate the public, raise funds for veterinary services and supplies, and to sustain program activities. 
Goal: Improve the quality of life in Hamtramck
Objective: Stabilize feral cat colonies
Tasks: Create a sustainable and highly qualified coalition. Hold meetings with local shelters and community stakeholders to form a steering committee. Perform a needs assessment and draft a budget for a large scale TNR program. Hold town hall meetings for public education and volunteer recruitment. Conduct marketing and fundraising campaigns as necessary. Execute the plan, collect data, and reevaluate the program. ","While the Hamtramck area boasts two shelters with veterinary services and a local organization dedicated to feral cats, no single agency has the resources to conduct a city wide TNR program. As evidenced by success stories in other dense cities, a coalition of providers and participants can ensure positive results.
A single unspayed female can birth over 100 kittens in her lifetime. Without veterinary intervention, feral cats are more aggressive and disease-prone. More than a minor annoyance, strays can accelerate blight. Foreclosures and other vacant structures draw feral colonies that deter investment, advance deterioration, and lower property values. 
TNR neutralizes offensive mating behaviors such as fighting, roaming, and caterwauling. Once spayed/neutered and vaccinated, feral cats can enjoy longer, healthier lives. A successful TNR program will improve the quality of life for all residents of Hamtramck - human and feline alike. ","H Soup funding would provide seed money needed to print meeting notices, agendas, surveys, and documents for public education. Since well fed volunteers are more productive, funding would provide a small snack allowance for meetings. Additionally, the steering committee will require funds to put on at least one spaghetti dinner type fundraiser for the purpose of sustainability and publicity.","The seed money to start a long term, city wide TNR program will be utilized during the first year of the coalition's inception.

""FlowerBeast"" is an icon & song combination that delivers the message of peace, racial unity, & respect for the environment, by engaging the talent, racial harmony, & a 'better world' philosophy of a revitalized East Jefferson community. Through the efforts of myself, (artist/musician/filmmaker, & resident of the Jefferson/Chalmers neighborhood), I will document the emergence of this 'global' icon, along with producing the supporting song- which will be recorded here in Detroit. Not only will I learn an incredible amount through the interaction with the community, but ultimately, the world will also receive the knowledge & benefits that come from experiencing this documentary film. With Detroit becoming recognized as the 'birthplace' of the ""FlowerBeast"" icon & song, I can only imagine how a creative project like this, will not only expand my knowledge, but will also contribute to a higher level of awareness, & consciousness, worldwide.

","The strong community participation & involvement in this project will not only serve initially as a 'local' role model, but will soon attract worldwide attention due to its positive & harmonious nature. Detroit deserves to be recognized as contributing something to the world on a 'global' scale, & I truly believe ""FlowerBeast"" is the answer!
","All money raised at EJ SOUP will be spent directly on production costs for the filming, recording of the song, & marketing/promotion of this project. I am extremely 'resourceful' in regards to budgeting my finances for a creative venture, so a little bit of funding can go a long way!  ","My time frame for this project is to begin working immediately, & to have a successfully completed venture by early spring of next year. This will be a perfect time in 2015 to start a publicity, marketing, & promotion campaign, to launch the 'birth' & emergence of ""FlowerBeast"" from the Jefferson/Chalmers community. I will be more than happy to attend all future EJ SOUP events in order to report on the progress/completion of my project. I know Detroit will be thrilled with its outcome, & also, its rewards!

We also hope that our presence will contribute to extending the already thriving commercial district of Grosse Pointe Park into Detroit along Kercheval avenue, that eventually the economic activity and sense of place is seamless and felt in common between citizens of Grosse Pointe Park and the East Jefferson community, rather than the sharp divide that is currently so palpable along Alter road.

Quintessence…The Story ©
By Clifford D. Robinson

“Quintessence…The Musical,” is about a day in the life of three multinational “BFF” teenage girls. 
A very special day-a day which will change their lives, and will warm your heart, forever.

The girls have a dream where they actually reach “Quintessence (Kwin-tes-sns).
 2) ”the fifth element, “above” Earth, Wind, Fire, and Water. The ethereal. 
This is where our play takes place. And where their story, is told. It is here, where the 
three girls meet nine unforgettable characters. All of them unique, and in their own way 
prolific. In that they represent the very essence of life, itself! The girls meet 
Flame (The Soul), and six manifestations of the Soul. They also meet “The Body”, and 
“The spirit”. 

Each of these characters are meaningful, provocative. And they all are Quintessence. 
1)“anything in its purest and most concentrated form”. The conversations 
between them and the girls will have something to say to every age group. Kids will love it! 
And the adults will be moved.","And why does this project matter to the Downtown community? 

The importance of a Project of this nature is overwhelming! In today’s society, children 
and teenagers are at risk! And for the most part, adults are no longer themselves either. 
The constant exposure to drugs, sex, violent/immoral mass media, negative music, and
crime is robbing our youth of their childhood, while stripping society of its basic intrinsic 
values. Consequently, getting “God’s Word” to the people is ever more imperative!
“To seek and to Save the lost” while girding up “the Body of Christ” is the objective of this 
Play. Seeing Quintessence will help. 
Additionally, this Play promotes oneness and unity of various nationalities, while 
recognizing and cherishing ethnic differences. Quintessence is a “live” illustration
that the secrets of the Universe are contained within each and every one of us.

We also know this community is still a Mecca for “world class” Talent of all kinds. And in all 
Ages. Our plan is to recruit, develop, and produce multi-media products utilizing this 
Talent. The first Project will be Quintessence…The Musical! A Musical generates jobs! Actors, 
Singers, Dancers, Song Writers, Musicians, Set Designers, Set Makers, Costume Making, 
Technicians, and Marketing/Sales.","Use of SOUP Grant Funding?

We will use this funding to enhance the Marketing effort to produce Posters and Flyers","What is the Time Frame?

“Quintessence…The Musical,” is about a day in the life of three multinational “BFF” teenage girls.  
A very special day-a day which will change their lives, and will warm your heart, forever.

The girls have a dream where they actually reach “Quintessence (Kwin-tes-sns).
 2) ”the fifth element, “above” Earth, Wind, Fire, and Water.  The ethereal.  
This is where our play takes place.  And where their story, is told. It is here, where the 
three girls meet nine unforgettable characters.  All of them unique, and in their own way 
prolific.  In that they represent the very essence of life, itself!  The girls meet 
Flame (The Soul), and six manifestations of the Soul.  They also meet “The Body”, and 
“The spirit”.  

Each of these characters are meaningful, provocative.  And they all are Quintessence. 
1)“anything in its purest and most concentrated form”.  The conversations 
between them and the girls will have something to say to every age group. Kids will love it!   
And the adults will be moved.  

","“For a time such as this- comes Quintessence…The Musical!""
And why does this project matter to the Central community? 

The importance of a Project of this nature is overwhelming!   In today’s society, children 
and teenagers are at risk!  And for the most part, adults are no longer themselves either.  
The constant exposure to drugs, sex, violent/immoral mass media, negative music, and
crime is robbing our youth of their childhood, while stripping society of its basic intrinsic 
values.  Consequently, getting “God’s Word” to the people is ever more imperative!
“To seek and to Save the lost” while girding up “the Body of Christ” is the objective of this 
Play. Seeing Quintessence will help.  
Additionally, this Play promotes oneness and unity of various nationalities, while 
recognizing and cherishing ethnic differences.  Quintessence is a “live” illustration
that the secrets of the Universe are contained within each and every one of us.

We also know this community is still a Mecca for “world class” Talent of all kinds.  And in all 
Ages.  Our plan is to recruit, develop, and produce multi-media products utilizing this 
Talent.  The first Project will be Quintessence…The Musical!  A Musical generates jobs!  Actors, 
Singers, Dancers, Song Writers, Musicians, Set Designers, Set Makers, Costume Making, 
Technicians, and Marketing/Sales.
"," Use of SOUP Grant Funding?

We will use this funding to enhance the Marketing effort to produce Posters and Flyers
","What is the Time Frame?

Quintessence…The Musical! will “Open” Spring/Summer 2014 at 1515 Broadway. We will then
Tour to a church in the Central community.

Is it a new video game, cellular phone or social network? No. It’s a Loom that makes rubber band bracelets. Suburban kids along with their parents are purchasing Looms and Rubber Bands like crazy! These kids are starting businesses, posting videos and making them to give as gifts. They are raising money for charities, their school and for themselves. And at least for now they are not consumed with television, video games or texting.

I am a naturopathic doctor and I work out of my home.  My project takes place in my home because this is where I do my work.  I educate and empower people who want and need to be healed naturally, how to use natural herbal remedies and plant based whole food nutrition to allow their bodies to heal naturally from the inside out.  I want to hold classes to certify others in the field of herbal science, so they can go out and help people who want and need natural herbal remedies and plant based whole food nutrition.  I currently do free presentations teaching people the benefits of using herbs and good food to help the body heal from dis-ease and dis-order.  To educate and empower people I will talk to them wherever I go and tell them the benefits of natural herbs and plant based whole foods.  I will hold classes in my home to teach others how they can share this knowledge with those they know and love.  I will continue to do presentations in people's homes, businesses and with organizations to tell everyone who will listen that true healing can come when we allow the body to heal itself naturally with help from nature.","The benefits of having Health and Healing Naturally in my neighborhood are as follows:
- Through education, one is empowered to do what is right because knowledge is power.  When you know you can help your body heal, and you can do it naturally, one's quality of life is improved giving everyone a chance to improve life around them for themselves and those they love.
- Give a man a fish he eats for a day.  Teach a man to fish he eats for a lifetime. My classes will certify people to become herbalists and this will give people the opportunity to create their own way of making a living and make them less dependent on a job - working for someone else.
- Imagine, a community where people are healthy, vibrant and full of vitality!  This is what mother nature's food does for us.  All of us deserve a better quality of life and we can get that by building better health naturally!  When you have your health you can create your wealth.  Not only material wealth, yet, wealth in terms of relationships with family and friends.  Wealth in terms of building a better community with our neighbors because we have the energy to get to work on improving our neighborhoods.","I will use SOUP funding to renovate my basement so I can hold seminars and classes for those what need and want to be healed naturally and for those that want to learn how to help others heal naturally as well.

These jellos are very popular en Los Angeles and Chicago, and I believe that Detroit deserves to know these particular jellos. 
","People can generate extra income, or, start a business network. I said before that this technique is a cultural addition to the jello making tradition, and I'm really curious about how creative can people become after learning how to make these kind of jello. Will people in Detroit add significant elements to something that is already beyond the ordinary? Ingredients are another business part. The ingredients are low cost, home owners can benefit by selling them, but, in order to run a professional business, one must work in a professional kitchen, which can be expensive. Restaurant owners can benefit by selling this new, elegant dessert.
","I would use it to call for community jello-making workshops. Right now, the priority would be seeking an affordable place to start giving classes. I already have the support of a restaurant in Southewest Detroit to perform a public demo. But, suggestions for public demos are accepted. Lately, some specific tools to achieve these jello flowers are being sold, and I found a way to make my own tools by using just a drinking straw. 
","I think that having a list of people really interested and available (to learn how to make these jellos), results will be done really quick, in about a week. Commercializing the product, would take a little longer.If I get chosen, I would  share my progress/completion in about a month. 
",Artistic Floral Jello ,"I would go to any community where people show real interest in learning how to make these jellos, or use them in any way. The project fits from home owners who need extra income, (usually ladies of any age, students, stay at home mothers, single mothers, artists, to restaurant owners who would like to add an exotic dessert to their customers, so, I'm open to anything. I have already worked in new ways to make and present these jellos in a more attractive and effective consumer point of view.

Being vagabonds in this way means that we have struggled to implement all of the projects and programs that could help us to truly fulfill our mission: to eliminate apathy, violence, prejudice and barriers to education through theatre productions, projects and programs; and to reestablish and expand Detroit’s theatre community. 

But now we have an amazing opportunity: to lease a storefront on Grand River from Grandmont Rosedale Development Corporation in the heart of that amazing neighborhood. For the first time, we will put down roots, become neighbors and not just itinerant artists, and go gangbusters to fulfill our mission and have a real impact on our community.
","Theatres have been proven time and again to boost economic activity wherever they exist. Patrons who travel to a show often get dinner, drinks, and/or coffee while they're out. A permanent theatre also contributes to a sense of community pride, and our theatre prides itself on telling stories that are important to Detroiters.

Beyond productions, being in a permanent space means that we can greatly expand our programming. We can share space with other theatre companies and local theatre students. We can reserve gallery space for local visual artists. We can host open mic nights, concerts, film screenings, and other events. We can provide space for workshops and educational programming not only for artists and adults, but for youth. And we will do all of that with input from the Grandmont Rosedale community.

Magenta Giraffe putting down roots means we can dedicate ourselves even more to providing services and programming that this community wants, needs, and deserves.
","Moving into a permanent space for the first time is an expensive proposition. While we are confident that some of what we need for the space will be donated in-kind or loaned to us, it will necessarily be of a DIY nature. That doesn't scare us; we've been doing theatre in a loft for two years and produced our first play in a space that was under construction!

The real challenge will be to muster up enough funding to pay our cash expenses for the first few months. We aim to sign a lease that begins May 1. Fees that must be paid to the city will total between $1600-2000, plus the security deposit and rent that must be paid to GRDC upon signing, which total $3900. Then there will be at least two months when the space will be under construction, and we will not be able to schedule programming during that time to recoup the cost of rent.

Grandmont Rosedale SOUP grant funding will alleviate the financial strain during these first months and enable us to move forward with the support of the community to which we are so dedicated. Without funding, this will be a struggle, and perhaps impossible.
","Our goal is to sign a lease that begins May 1, and to spend that month meeting with the neighbors and holding a ""housewarming party"" to welcome our patrons to the new space. The month of June will be dedicated to the theatre build out. If necessary, the build out will extend through July, and we will begin programming no later than August. 

We would be thrilled to share the project's progress whenever and however best fits Grandmont Rosedale SOUP's needs!

This day camp will take place during an afternoon in the spring, and will consist of various individual and team-building exercises, soccer drills, and fun activities. Participants aged from 6 through 17 are welcome to attend. The camp will be free to all, though ideally participants will register in advance. All kids will receive a Grandmont Rosedale soccer t-shirt designed by a local artist.

The camp will be staffed by volunteer players from our two local teams: Grandmont Rosedale and Old Redford. Most of these players are connected to the GR neighborhoods in meaningful and lasting ways, as current and past residents, with friends and family ties. Between the two teams, there are around 50 players to draw from, which will allow for a low kids-to-coaches ratio, which is essential in mentoring and teaching the basics of the sport.
","Soccer has proven to be a great vehicle for community, mentorship, and growth in Detroit. Detroit City Futbol League, a recreational soccer league founded just five years ago and of which our teams are members, currently has more than a thousand participants and 34 neighborhood-based teams. As a sport, soccer is particularly low-cost and truly global, as it connects people from all countries and cultures. Few sports are as team-driven as soccer, which accommodates all types of players and teaches the values of both individuality and cooperation. 

Also, GR has a long-standing youth soccer tradition that our teams are committed to continuing through community service and mentorship. This proposal fits right into this tradition.
","The grant will be used to buy equipment, such as: pop-up goals, cones, pinnies, balls, t-shirts, and healthy snacks.

Event workshops will be evaluated for data collection in the Brightmoor Community.",Brightmoor,313-673-38564/21/14 16:42,Ivan Branson,Ivan.branson@detroitk12.org,Community Caregivers,"Imagine if you will, coming home from school one day to learn your mother received a 15 year sentence and an aunt or cousin would be picking you up to live with them and their 4 children for the rest of your young life? There is little time to prepare and you can only take a few items because there is very little space for you. 

A group of educators from Dixon Preparatory Academy, community members, educators and stakeholders will take 80 students, 17 that reside in the Brightmoor community and attend Dixon on a three day mentoring retreat in Dundee, MI.  The students were selected because one or both parents are either deceased or incarcerated. These students have been ""taken in"" by others who help as much as possible. However many of the families who have stepped in already had children of their own and resources were limited.  There is usually very little money, time and special nurturing time for these young people.  On top of losing the love, nurturing and support of a parent, these students must often make do with what is left over. Many are essentially housed and are making a way on their own.  The retreat will feature activities to start the process of building a bond with a community member in a group setting.  These relationships are expected to support the youth in their school and community life.  The retreat will take place at a hotel out of the city in order to allow the students to feel at ease outside of the urban environment.  Meals and supplies will be provided so that each student experiences the opportunity to experience the event in a way that tells them that someone planned for them.  The students will be transported by bus to the retreat.  The goal is to create a network that will support these young people who have lost the direction, support and nurturing of their primary parent. Imagine if you will, that nobody cared that you lost the love of your mother and your first and most dependable care-giver.","This project will help youth that reside in the Brighmoor community feel a part of a loving family that will support them in their home, school and community life.Students are expected to perform better academically, socially and emotionally.  Statistics show that children that grow up with incarcerated parents have a higher likelihood of going to prison themselves.   They also perform more poorly in school and have a higher incidence of emotional and mental challenges.  This project will take the first step in building a bridge to support these students during a difficult time.  They will remain healthy assets to the community.",The funds will be used to handle the cost of food and some supplies for the students from the Brightmoor community.,The project is expected to take place during the last week in May.  We will take pictures and journal during the event.  We will be happy to report out our outcomes either with a verbal or Powerpointe presentation.  We hope to identify some youth participants who are comfortable sharing their experiences.  They may however be too self conscious to share in public.  In that case adult mentees will share along with pictures and narratives from the event.

It will start as a quarterly pub crawl and restaurant night, to help the chosen businesses gain exposure and build their clientele.  ","Brightmoor needs more bars and restaurants with consistent hours and good quality food.  In its hay day Brightmoor had 25 bars and restaurants on Fenkell alone, Now there are 2 Sneekers and Raynitas.  Working with them to expand hours and increase visibility helps to expand the local economy.  With the growing food movement in Brightmoor this can fit in perfectly with the concept of Farm to Table.  

Right now when people ask someone where they can grab food in Brightmoor, the answer is Scotty's or a sandwich at Java House. If its after 9pm the answer is go Downtown or to the suburbs.  We need to create jobs locally and the more we sustain the local business community the more we can create jobs in Brightmoor. 
Last but not least, these events will be used to engage people who have left Brightmoor and have yet to experience the innovation happening in the neighborhood giving them insight into how Brightmoor has adapted and become a safe welcoming environment once more.  ","Funding will be used for promotional materials to promote the quarterly events. 
Distribution sites will be local businesses and downtown destinations.  ","The hope is to have the first event in April, if successful the second one will be the end of July.  I am willing to come report on progress but also want to invite everyone to come ""Experience Brightmoor"" for themselves.
